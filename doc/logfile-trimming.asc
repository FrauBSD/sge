1) Description
--------------
 
   Grid Engine daemons create logfiles called "messages" in their respective
   spool directories. Also an 'accounting' file is created. The current Grid
   Engine release provides not mechanism for truncating and rotating the log
   files and the 'accounting' file automatically.

   Therefore a script template for truncating logfiles, the accounting and
   the statistics file is provided in the directory

      <sge_root>/util/logchecker.sh

   This script is copied during qmaster installation to the
   '<sge_root>/<sge_cell>/common' directory.

   The script is not activated by any of the Grid Engine daemons
   automatically. It is intended to be edited according to the needs of your
   site. After customizing the script you can add to your crontab(s). The
   script is designed to run in verbose mode or completely silent. It can
   also run in a mode where it only prints what would be done. The script
   accepts only two command line parameters for overriding the "ACTION_ON"
   parameter and the location of the exec daemon spool directory (see
   below).


   Grid Engine daemons create logfiles in the following directories. 
   'qmaster_spool_dir' and 'execd_spool_dir' are defined in the global
   cluster configuration, the '<execd_spool_dir>' can be overridden in the
   local cluster configuration of every execution host (usually this is not
   done). The <sge_cell> directory usually is called 'default', and only if
   the $SGE_CELL variable is used, 'default' is overridden.

   Location of Grid Engine log files:

      <qmaster_spool_dir>/messages
      <qmaster_spool_dir>/schedd/messages
      <execd_spool_dir>/<hostname>/messages
      <sge_root>/<sge_cell>/common/accounting

   Since these directories can all be located in the same directory
   hierarchy in a shared NFS filesystem or the execd spool directories can
   point to a local directory, it is possible to specify with the
   "ACTION_ON" parameter (see below) what 'messages' files should be rotated
   when the script is called.


2) Variables
------------

   The following variables need to be configured in the script. The "|"
   character specifies an alternative. All variables in the script must be
   entered in Bourne shell syntax. So there may be no white space before or
   after the equal "=" sign.

   UNCONFIGURED=yes|no

      After the script is configured you should set this value to "no". If
      set to "yes" (or any other value), the script only will print out what
      would be done.
 
      Default: UNCONFIGURED=yes


   ECHO=:|echo

      The colon ":" is the null command in the shell. If you set the
      variable to this value, the script will work silently (only error
      messages are printed).  If you set the value to "echo" the script will
      print what it is currently doing.

      Default: ECHO=echo


   SGE_ROOT=<your_sge_root>

      Enter the path of your SGE_ROOT directory here.

      Default: SGE_ROOT=undefined

   SGE_CELL=default|<your_cell_name>

      Enter the name of your cell, if not 'default'

      Default: SGE_CELL=default


   ACTION_ON=1|2|3|4

      1 = work on qmaster and scheduler "messages" files only
      2 = work on "messages" file on current host only
      3 = work on all accessible execd "messages" files of global config
      4 = work on qmaster "messages" and all accessible execd "messages" files

      Default: ACTION_ON=4

   ACTIONSIZE=<size_inkilobyte>

      rotate/delete only if file size exceeds ACTIONSIZE in kilobytes. If
      ACTIONSIZE is set to 0, always work on "messages" file.

      Default: ACTIONSIZE=0


   KEEPOLD=<number>

      Defines the number of old messages files to be preserved. E.g. "30"
      means that "messages.0" to "messages.29" are saved. A value of "0"
      means no backup is done. The most recent messages file has the
      extension ".0".

      Default: KEEPOLD=30
      
   GZIP=yes|no

      yes = compress rotated "messages.0" file with gzip
      no  = leave rotated "messages.0" file uncompressed

      Default: GZIP=yes


   ACCT=yes|no

      yes = rotate accounting file when rotating qmaster 'messages' file
      no  = don't rotate accounting file

      Default: ACCT=no

3) Command line parameters
--------------------------

   The script accepts the following command line parameters:

   -execd_spool <spool_dir_of_local_execd>

      Define the base directory of the execd spool directory. Do not add the
      unqualified hostname in the command line. The hostname is added
      automatically by the script.

   -action_on 1|2|3|4

      Override the "ACTION_ON" variable in the script.


4) Examples:
------------

   a) All Grid Engine spool directories are shared. You can call the script
      on any of your Grid Engine hosts or on your file server.

      --> set ACTION_ON to "4" in the script. Set other values according to
          your needs and add the script to your crontab of one of the above
          machines.


   b) Grid Engine execd spool are defines only through the global
      cluster configuration, but point to a local directory.

     --> set ACTION_ON="3". Add the start of the script to all crontabs
         of your execds in your cluster. On your qmaster machine (or on your
         file server) add the following call of the script to your crontab:

         <path_to_script>/logchecker.sh -action_on 1


   c) Grid Engine spool directories of execds are defined in the local
      configuration.

      --> . Set ACTION_ON="2" in the script

          . On  your qmaster machine (or on your file server) add the
            following call of the script to your crontab:

               <path_to_script>/logchecker.sh -action_on 1

          . On your exec hosts add the following line:

               <path_to_script>/logchecker.sh -execd_spool <local_execd_spool>
