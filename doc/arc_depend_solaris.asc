Dependencies for Solaris 7 and later
------------------------------------

Processor Sets:

	Grid Engine supports Solaris processor sets (see psrset(1)). The
	"processors" queue configuration parameter is interpreted as a
	processor set ID number. Grid Engine assigns the jobs started in a
	queue to a valid processor set referenced by the "processors" entry. 
	Processor sets have to be created and managed outside Grid Engine,
	for instance with the psradm(1) command.

	Processor set affinity can only be assigned with root permission.
	Thus Grid Engine will only make use of the definitions in the
	"processors" queue configuration parameter if the execution daemon
	and thus the shepherd process are started with root permission.
