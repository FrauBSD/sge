DESCRIPTION
     <I>sge</I>_<I>st</I> controls the Sun  Grid  Engine  support  for  Service
     Tags.   A  Service  Tag  support  improve  the monitoring of
     usages of the Sun Grid Engine.

OPTIONS
     enable
          Enables the Service Tags support for Sun  Grid  Engine.
          If the Service Tags packages are installed on the host,
          the presence of the product  instance  service  tag  is
          checked in every start of the qmaster daemon.


     disable
          Disables the Service Tags support for Sun Grid Engine.


     register
          Create the product instance service tag.


     unregister
          Remove the product instance service tag.


     check
          Checks the status of the product instance service  tag.
          If  not  registered, the option returns "unregistered".
          If      registered,      the       option       returns
          "registered:&lt;product_instance_urn&gt;"


     enabled
          Check the status of the service tags  support.  If  the
          service tags are enabled by Sun Grid Engine administra-
          tor, the option returns "true", otherwise "false".


     supported
          Checks if the Service Tags are supported on this  host.
          This  option validates the presence of the Service Tags
          packages on the host and checks if they  are  correctly
          installed.  If Service Tags are supported on this host,
          the option return a word "true", otherwise "false".

The Service Tags Support
     Service  Tags  enables  automatic  discovery   of   systems,
     software  and  services.  A  service tag uniquely identifies
     each tagged asset, and allows the asset  information  to  be
     shared over a local network in a standard XML format.

     The Sun Grid Engine can create a service tag for one cluster
     installation.   A service tag entry is stored in the Service
     Tag registry. Each service tag has an unique instance  iden-
     tifier  which  is  generated when the record is added to the
     registry. This identifier is used as the key when  accessing
     the record.

     The discoverer and listener services installed together with
     Service  Tags  on  a  host. They provide a way to discover a
     service tags via the network. The discoverer is a  UDP-based
     application  which  exists  to provide information about the
     listener.  The listener is  a  TCP-based  application  which
     provides a way to gather service tag and associated environ-
     mental information.

     The discoverer service is used by operating  system  upgrade
     or  register  tools  to  send  the service tags data to SUN.
     There is no other way, how to propagate the  collected  data
     to  SUN  than  through the registration tool. The data to be
     send can be inspected and accepted. The Service Tags Data is
     going to be analyzed.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell. To address a Sun Grid Engine cell

RESTRICTIONS
     <I>sge</I>_<I>st</I> The command must be called with Sun Grid Engine admin
     rights or root permissions.

FILES
     sge_st creates a st.enabled file in  SGE_CELL\common  direc-
     tory.  If  available,  the file contains the product related
     urn key. This key will be used for upgrading purposes.
