NAME
     SGE_Helper_Service.exe - Sun Grid Engine job execution agent
     helper service

SYNOPSIS
     SGE_Helper_Service.exe [ -help | -install | -uninstall ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>SGE</I>_<I>Helper</I>_<I>Service</I>.<I>exe</I> <I>helps</I> <I>the</I> <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> to run Windows
     jobs  that request to be allowed to display their GUI on the
     visible Desktop. It is a Win32 service that  is  started  at
     boot  time  under  the SYSTEM account, giving it the permis-
     sions to give any process  the  permissions  to  access  the
     visible Desktop.
     This service runs independently of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> (i.e. it
     is  not started and stopped together with the execution dae-
     mon) and there can be only  one  SGE_Helper_Service.exe  per
     host.
     Jobs can request to be allowed to display their GUI  on  the
     visible desktop by requesting the resource "display_win_gui"
     (qsub -l display_win_gui=1). See <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/submit.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">submit(1)</A></B>  ,  option  "-v",
     for information on how to set a job environment variable.
     When   running   GUI   jobs,   the   environment    variable
     SGE_BACKGND_MODE  can  be used to direct where the output of
     the GUI will  be  displayed.  If  the  environment  variable
     SGE_BACKGND_MODE   is   set   to   "TRUE"  or  "1"  and  "-l
     display_win_gui=true" is requested, the job  is  started  by
     the  helper service, but the GUI is not opened on the execu-
     tion host's screen.  Instead  it  is  opened  on  a  virtual
     screen.

OPTIONS
  -help

  -install

     permissions to install the service.

  -uninstall

     can be uninstalled. See  the  Windows  command  net.exe  for
     information on how to stop a service.
