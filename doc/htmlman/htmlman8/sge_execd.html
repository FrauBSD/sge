NAME
     sge_execd - Sun Grid Engine job execution agent

SYNOPSIS
     sge_execd [ -help ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> controls the Sun Grid Engine queues local  to  the
     machine  on which <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> is running and executes/controls
     the jobs sent from <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> to be run on these queues.

OPTIONS
  -help
     Prints a listing of all options.

LOAD SENSORS
     If a load sensor is configured for <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> via either  the
     global  host  configuration  or  the execution-host-specific
     cluster configuration  (See  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.),  the  executable
     path of the load sensor is invoked by <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> on a regular
     basis and delivers one or multiple load figures for the exe-
     cution  host  (e.g.   users currently logged in) or the com-
     plete cluster (e.g.  free  disk  space  on  a  network  wide
     scratch  file  system). The load sensor may be a script or a
     binary executable. In either case its handling of the  STDIN
     and  STDOUT  streams and its control flow must comply to the
     following rules:

     The load sensor must be written as an infinite loop  waiting
     at  a  certain  point  for  input  from STDIN. If the string
     "quit" is read from STDIN,  the  load  sensor  should  exit.
     When  an  end-of-line  is  read  from  STDIN,  a  load  data
     retrieval cycle should start. The load sensor then  performs
     whatever  operation is necessary to compute the desired load
     figures.  At the end of the cycle the load sensor writes the
     result to stdout. The format is as follows:

     <B>o</B>  A load value report starts with a  line  containing  only
        either the word  "start" or the word "begin".

     <B>o</B>  Individual load values are separated by newlines.

     <B>o</B>  Each load value report consists of three parts  separated
        by colons (":") and containing no blanks.

     <B>o</B>  The first part of a load value information is either  the
        name  of  the host for which load is reported or the spe-
        cial name "global".

     <B>o</B>  The second part is the symbolic name of the load value as
        defined  in  the  host  or  global complex list (see <I>com-</I>
        <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/plex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">plex(5)</A></B> for details). If a load  value  is  reported  for
        which no entry in the host or global complex list exists,
        the reported load value is not used.

     <B>o</B>  The third part is the measured load value.

     <B>o</B>  A load value report ends with a line with only  the  word
        "end".

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell.  To  address  a  Sun  Grid  Engine cell
                    <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

     SGE_EXECD_PORT If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_execd" instead to define that port.

RESTRICTIONS
     <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> usually is started from root on  each  machine  in
     the  Sun  Grid  Engine pool.  If started by a normal user, a
     spool  directory  must  be  used  to  which  the  user   has
     read/write access. In this case only jobs being submitted by
     that same user are handled correctly by the system.

FILES
     sgepasswd  contains  a  list  of  user  names   and    their
     corresponding  encrypted  passwords. If available, the pass-
     word  file  will  be   used   by  sge_execd. To  change  the
     contents  of  this file please use the sgepasswd command. It
     is not advised to  change that file manually.
