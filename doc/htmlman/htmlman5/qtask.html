NAME
     qtask - file format of the qtask file.

DESCRIPTION
     A <I>qtask</I> file defines which commands  are  submitted  to  Sun
     Grid  Engine  for  remote  execution by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtcsh(1)</A></B>.  The <I>qtask</I>
     file optionally may contain <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B> command-line parameters.
     These  parameters  are  passed  to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B> command being
     used by <I>qtcsh</I> to submit the commands.

     A cluster global <I>qtask</I> file defining cluster  wide  defaults
     and  a  user  specific  <I>qtask</I> file eventually overriding and
     enhancing those definitions are supported. The cluster  glo-
     bal file resides at &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell/common/qtask, while the
     user specific file can be found at ~/.qtask. An  exclamation
     mark preceding command definitions in the cluster global can
     be used by the administrator to deny overriding of such com-
     mands by users.

FORMAT
     The principle format of the <I>qtask</I> file is that  of  a  tabu-
     lated  list.  Each  line  starting with a '#' character is a
     comment line. Each line despite comment lines defines a com-
     mand to be started remotely.

     Definition starts with the  command  name  that  must  match
     exactly  the name as typed in a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtcsh(1)</A></B> command-line. Path-
     names are not allowed in  <I>qtask</I>  files.  Hence  absolute  or
     relative  pathnames in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtcsh(1)</A></B> command-lines always lead to
     local execution even if the commands itself are the same  as
     defined in the <I>qtask</I> files.

     The command name can be followed by an arbitrary  number  of
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B>  option  arguments which are passed on to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B> by
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtcsh(1)</A></B>.

     An exclamation mark prefixing the  command  in  the  cluster
     global  <I>qtask</I>  file prevents overriding by the user supplied
     <I>qtask</I> file.

EXAMPLES
     The following <I>qtask</I> file

          netscape -l a=sol-sparc64 -v DISPLAY=myhost:0
          grep -l h=filesurfer
          verilog -l veri_lic=1

     designates the applications netscape, grep and  verilog  for
     interactive   remote  execution  through  Sun  Grid  Engine.
     Netscape is requested to run only on Solaris64 architectures
     with  the  DISPLAY  environment  variable set to 'myhost:0',
     grep only runs on the host named  'filesurfer'  and  verilog
     requests  availability  of a verilog license in order to get
     executed remotely.
