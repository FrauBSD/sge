NAME
     sge_priority - Sun Grid Engine job priorities

DESCRIPTION
     Sun Grid Engine provide means for controlling  job  dispatch
     and run-time priorities. The dispatch priority indicates the
     importance of pending jobs  compared  with  each  other  and
     determines  the  order  in  which Sun Grid Engine dispatches
     jobs to queue instances. The  run-time  priority  determines
     the  CPU  allocation  that  the  operating system assigns to
     jobs.

  JOBS DISPATCH PRIORITY
     A job's dispatch priority is affected by a  number  of  fac-
     tors:

     <B>o</B>  the identity of the submitting user

     <B>o</B>  the project under which the job is submitted (or alterna-
        tively, the default project of the submitting user)

     <B>o</B>  any resources requested by the job

     <B>o</B>  the job's submit time

     <B>o</B>  the job's initiation deadline time (if specified)

     <B>o</B>  the -p priority specified for the job (also known as  the
        POSIX priority "pprio")

     The effect of each of these is governed by the overall  pol-
     icy  setup,  which  is  split into three top-level contribu-
     tions.   Each   of   these   is   configured   through   the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B>  parameters weight_priority, weight_ticket and
     weight_urgency.  These  three  parameters  control  to  what
     degree POSIX priority, ticket policy, and urgency policy are
     in effect. To facilitate interpretation, the raw  priorities
     ("tckts"/"urg"/"ppri")             are            normalized
     ("ntckts"/"nurg"/"npprior") before they are used  to  calcu-
     late  job  priorities  ("prio"). Normalization maps each raw
     urgency/ticket/priority  value into a range between 0 and 1.

        npprior = normalized(ppri)
        nurg    = normalized(urg)
        ntckts  = normalized(tckts)

        prio    = weight_priority * pprio +
                  weight_urgency  * nurg +
                  weight_ticket   * ntckts

     The higher a job's  priority  value,  the  earlier  it  gets
     dispatched.
     The urgency policy defines an urgency value  for  each  job.
     The urgency value

        urg     =  rrcontr + wtcontr + dlcontr

     consists   of   the   resource   requirement    contribution
     ("rrcontr"),  the  waiting time contribution ("wtcontr") and
     the deadline contribution ("dlcontr").

     The resource  requirement  contribution  is  adding  up  all
     resource requirements of a job into a single numeric value.

        rrcontr = Sum over all(hrr)

     with an "hrr" for each hard resource request.  Depending  on
     the  resource  type two different methods are used to deter-
     mine the value to be used for "hrr" here. For  numeric  type
     resource  requests,  the  "hrr"  represents  how  much  of a
     resource a job requests (on a per-slot basis  for  pe  jobs)
     and  how  "important"  this  resource  is considered in com-
     parison to other resources. This is expressed  by  the  for-
     mula:

        hrr      = rurg * assumed_slot_allocation * request

     where the resource's urgency value ("rurg") is as  specified
     under      urgency      in     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>,     the     job's
     assumed_slot_allocation represents the number of slots  sup-
     posedly  assigned  to  the  job, and the per-slot request is
     that which was specified using the -l  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>  option.  For
     string type requests the formula is simply

        hrr      = "rurg"

     and directly assigns the resource urgency value as specified
     under urgency in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>.

     The waiting time contribution represents a weighted  weight-
     ing time of the jobs

        wtcontr = waiting_time * weight_waiting_time

     with the waiting time in seconds and the weight_waiting_time
     value as specified in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B>.

     The deadline contribution has an increasing effect  as  jobs
     approach  their deadline initiation time (see the -dl option
     in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>).   It  is  defined  as  the  quotient  of   the
     weight_deadline  value  from <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B> and the (steadily
     decreasing) free time in seconds until  deadline  initiation
     time

        dlcontr = weight_deadline / free_time

     or is set to 0 for non-deadline jobs.   After  the  deadline
     passes, the value is static and equal to weight_deadline.

     The ticket policy unites functional, override and share tree
     policies in the ticket value ("tckts"), as is defined as the
     sum of the specific ticket values  ("ftckt"/"otckt"/"stckt")
     for each sub-policy (functional, override, share):

         tckts = ftckt + otckt + stckt

     The ticket policies provide  a  broad  range  of  means  for
     influencing  both  job  dispatch and runtime priorities on a
     per job, per user, per project, and  per  department  basis.
     See  the  Sun  Grid  Engine  Installation and Administration
     Guide for details.

  JOB RUN-TIME PRIORITY
     The run-time priority can be dynamically adjusted  in  order
     to  meet  the goals set with the ticket policy. Dynamic run-
     time priority adjustment can be turned  off  (default)  glo-
     bally  using  reprioritize_interval  in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B> If no
     dynamic run-time priority  adjustment  is  done  at  a  host
     level,  the  priority  specification  in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B> is in
     effect.

     Note that urgency and POSIX priorities do NOT affect runtime
     priority.
