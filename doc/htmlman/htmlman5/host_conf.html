NAME
     host_conf - Sun Grid  Engine  execution  host  configuration
     file format

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Host</I>_<I>conf</I> reflects the format of the template file  for  the
     execution  host  configuration.  Via the -ae and -me options
     of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B> command, you can  add  execution  hosts  and
     modify  the configuration of any execution host in the clus-
     ter. Default execution host entries are added  automatically
     as  soon  as  a <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> registers to <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> for
     the very first time from a certain host. The  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>  -sel
     switch can be used to display a list of execution host being
     currently configured in your Sun Grid Engine system. Via the
     -se option you can print the execution host configuration of
     a specified host.

     The special hostname "global" can be used to define  cluster
     global characteristics.

     Note, Sun Grid Engine allows  backslashes  (\)  be  used  to
     escape  newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the
     newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any
     interpretation.

FORMAT
     The format of a <I>host</I>_<I>conf</I> file is defined as follows:

  hostname
     The  execution  hosts  name  as  defined  for  <I>host</I>_<I>name</I>  in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

  load_scaling
     A comma separated list of scaling values to  be  applied  to
     each  or  part  of  the  load  values  being reported by the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the host and being defined  in  the  cluster
     global  "host"  complex  (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>).  The load scaling
     factors are intended to level hardware or  operating  system
     specific differences between execution hosts.

     The syntax of a load factor  specification  is  as  follows:
     First  the  name of the load value (as defined in the "host"
     complex) is given and, separated by an equal sign, the  load
     scaling  value is provided. No blanks are allowed in between
     the load_scaling value string.

     The parameter load_scaling is not meaningful for the defini-
     tion of the "global" host.

  complex_values
     complex_values  defines  quotas  for   resource   attributes
     managed via this host. Each complex attribute is followed by
     an "=" sign and the value specification compliant  with  the
     complex  attribute  type (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>).  Quota specifica-
     tions are separated by commas.

     The quotas are related to the resource  consumption  of  all
     jobs on a host in the case of consumable resources (see <I>com-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/plex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">plex(5)</A></B> for details on consumable  resources)  or  they  are
     interpreted  on  a  per  job  slot basis in the case of non-
     consumable resources.  Consumable  resource  attributes  are
     commonly  used  to  manage  free  memory, free disk space or
     available floating software  licenses  while  non-consumable
     attributes  usually  define distinctive characteristics like
     type of hardware installed.

     For consumable resource  attributes  an  available  resource
     amount  is  determined  by  subtracting the current resource
     consumption of all running jobs on the host from  the  quota
     in the complex_values list. Jobs can only be dispatched to a
     host  if  no  resource  requests  exceed  any  corresponding
     resource  availability  obtained  by  this scheme. The quota
     definition  in  the  complex_values  list  is  automatically
     replaced  by the current load value reported for this attri-
     bute, if load is monitored for  this  resource  and  if  the
     reported  load  value is more stringent than the quota. This
     effectively avoids oversubscription of resources.

     Note: Load values replacing  the  quota  specifications  may
     have  become  more  stringent  because they have been scaled
     (see  load_scaling  above)   and/or   load   adjusted   (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B>).   The  -<I>F</I>  option  of  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qstat(1)</A></B> and the load
     display in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmon(1)</A></B> queue control  dialog  (activated  by
     clicking  on  a queue icon while the "Shift" key is pressed)
     provide detailed information on the actual  availability  of
     consumable  resources  and on the origin of the values taken
     into account currently.

     Note also: The resource consumption of  running  jobs  (used
     for  the  availability  calculation) as well as the resource
     requests of the jobs waiting to be dispatched either may  be
     derived  from  explicit  user requests during job submission
     (see the -<I>l</I> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>) or  from  a  "default"  value
     configured  for  an attribute by the administrator (see <I>com-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/plex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">plex(5)</A></B>).  The  -<I>r</I>  option  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qstat(1)</A></B>  can  be  used  for
     retrieving  full  detail  on the actual resource requests of
     all jobs in the system.

     For non-consumable resources Sun Grid Engine simply compares
     the job's attribute requests with the corresponding specifi-
     cation in complex_values taking the relation operator of the
     complex  attribute definition into account (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>).
     If the result of the comparison is "true", the host is suit-
     able  for  the job with respect to the particular attribute.
     For parallel jobs each job slot to be occupied by a parallel
     task is meant to provide the same resource attribute value.

     Note: Only numeric complex attributes can be defined as con-
     sumable  resources  and  hence  non-numeric  attributes  are
     always handled on a per job slot basis.

     The default value  for  this  parameter  is  NONE,  i.e.  no
     administrator  defined resource attribute quotas are associ-
     ated with the host.

  load_values
     This entry cannot be configured but  is  only  displayed  in
     case  of  a  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>  -se  command.  All  load  values  are
     displayed as reported by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the  host.  The
     load  values  are  enlisted  in a comma separated list. Each
     load value start with its name, followed by  an  equal  sign
     and the reported value.

  processors
     Note: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
     This entry cannot be configured but  is  only  displayed  in
     case  of  a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B> -se command. Its value is the number of
     processors which has been detected by  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  on  the
     corresponding host.

  usage_scaling
     The format is equivalent to load_scaling  (see  above),  the
     only  valid  attributes to be scaled however are cpu for CPU
     time consumption, mem for Memory consumption aggregated over
     the  life-time  of  jobs and io for data transferred via any
     I/O devices. The default NONE means "no scaling",  i.e.  all
     scaling factors are 1.

  user_lists
     The user_lists parameter contains a comma separated list  of
     so  called user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>.
     Each user contained in at least one of the  enlisted  access
     lists has access to the host. If the user_lists parameter is
     set to NONE (the default) any  user  has  access  being  not
     explicitly  excluded via the xuser_lists parameter described
     below.  If a user  is  contained  both  in  an  access  list
     enlisted  in  xuser_lists  and user_lists the user is denied
     access to the host.

  xuser_lists
     The xuser_lists parameter contains a comma separated list of
     so  called user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>.
     Each user contained in at least one of the  enlisted  access
     lists  is not allowed to access the host. If the xuser_lists
     parameter is set to NONE (the default) any user has  access.
     If  a  user  is contained both in an access list enlisted in
     xuser_lists and user_lists the user is denied access to  the
     host.

  projects
     The projects parameter contains a comma  separated  list  of
     projects  that  have access to the host. Any projects not in
     this list are denied access to the host. If set to NONE (the
     default),  any  project  has access that is not specifically
     excluded via the xprojects parameter described below.  If  a
     project  is  in  both the projects and xprojects parameters,
     the project is denied access to the host.

  xprojects
     The xprojects parameter contains a comma separated  list  of
     projects  that are denied access to the host. If set to NONE
     (the default), no projects  are  denied  access  other  than
     those   denied   access  based  on  the  projects  parameter
     described above.  If a project is in both the  projects  and
     xprojects  parameters,  the  project is denied access to the
     host.

  report_variables
     The report_variables parameter contains  a  comma  separated
     list  of  variables  that  shall be written to the reporting
     file.  The variables listed here  will  be  written  to  the
     reporting  file when a load report arrives from an execution
     host.

     Default settings can  be  done  in  the  global  host.  Host
     specific  settings  for  report_variables will override set-
     tings from the global host.
