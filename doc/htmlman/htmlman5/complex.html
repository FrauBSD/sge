NAME
     complex - Sun Grid Engine complexes configuration file  for-
     mat

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Complex</I> reflects the format of the Sun Grid  Engine  complex
     configuration.   The  definition  of complex attributes pro-
     vides all  pertinent  information  concerning  the  resource
     attributes  a user may request for a Sun Grid Engine job via
     the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> -l option and for the  interpretation  of  these
     parameters within the Sun Grid Engine system.

     The Sun Grid Engine complex object defines all entries which
     are  used  for  configuring  the global, the host, and queue
     object. The system has a set of pre defined  entries,  which
     are  assigned to a host or queue per default.  In a addition
     can the user define new entries and assign them  to  one  or
     multiple   objects.   Each   load  value  has  to  have  its
     corresponding complex entry object, which defines  the  type
     and the relational operator for it.

  defining resource attributes
     The complex configuration should not be  accessed  directly.
     In  order  to  add  or  modify complex entries, the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>
     options -Mc and -mc should be used instead.  While  the  -Mc
     option takes a <I>complex</I> configuration file as an argument and
     overrides the current configuration, the -mc option bring up
     an editor filled in with the current <I>complex</I> configuration.

     The provided  list  contains  all  definitions  of  resource
     attributes  in  the system. Adding a new entry means to pro-
     vide: name, shortcut, type, relop, requestable,  consumable,
     default, and urgency. The fields are described below. Chang-
     ing one is easily done by updating the field to  change  and
     removing  an  entry by deleting its definition. An attribute
     can only be removed, when it is not referenced in a host  or
     queue  object  anymore.  Also  does the system have a set of
     default resource attributes which are always attached  to  a
     host  or  queue.  They cannot be deleted nor can the type of
     such an attribute be changed.

  working with resource attributes
     Before a user can request a resource attribute it has to  be
     attached to the global, host, or cqueue object. The resource
     attribute exists only for the objects, it got attached to  (
     if it is attached to the global object(qconf -me global), it
     exits system wide, host object: only on that host (qconf -me
     NAME): cqueue object: only on that cqueue (qconf -mq NAME)).

     When the user attached a resource attribute  to  an  object,
     one  also  has  to assign a value to it; the resource limit.
     Another way to get a resource attribute  value  is  done  by
     configuring a load sensor for that attribute.

  Default queue resource attributes
     In its default form it contains a selection of parameters in
     the  queue  configuration  as defined in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.  The
     queue configuration parameters being requestable for  a  job
     by the user in principal are:

          qname
          hostname
          notify
          calendar
          min_cpu_interval
          tmpdir
          seq_no
          s_rt
          h_rt
          s_cpu
          h_cpu
          s_data
          h_data
          s_stack
          h_stack
          s_core
          h_core
          s_rss
          h_rss

  Default host resource attributes
     The standard set of host related attributes consists of  two
     categories. he first category is built by several queue con-
     figuration attributes which are particularly suitable to  be
     managed on a host basis. These attributes are:

          slots
          s_vmem
          h_vmem
          s_fsize
          h_fsize
     (please refer to <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).

     Note: Defining these attributes in the host  complex  is  no
     contradiction  to  having  them also in the queue configura-
     tion. It allows maintaining the corresponding resources on a
     host level and at the same time on a queue level. Total vir-
     tual free memory (h_vmem) can be managed  for  a  host,  for
     example,  and a subset of the total amount can be associated
     with a queue on that host.

     The second attribute category in the standard  host  complex
     are  the default load values Every <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> periodically
     reports load to <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.  The  reported  load  values
     are  either the standard Sun Grid Engine load values such as
     the CPU load average (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/uptime.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">uptime(1)</A></B>) or load values  defined
     by  the  Sun Grid Engine administration (see the load_sensor
     parameter in the cluster configuration <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>  and  the
     <I>Sun</I>   <I>Grid</I>   <I>Engine</I>   <I>Installation</I>  <I>and</I>  <I>Administration</I>  for
     details).  The characteristics definition for  the  standard
     load  values  is  part  of  the  default host complex, while
     administrator defined load values require extension  of  the
     host     complex.     Please     refer     to    the    file
     &lt;sge_root&gt;/doc/load_parameters.asc for detailed  information
     on the standard set of load values.

  Overriding attributes
     One attribute can be assigned to  the  global  object,  host
     object, and queue object at the same time. On the host level
     it might get its value from the user defined resource  limit
     and  a  load sensor. In case that the attribute is a consum-
     able, we have in addition to the resource limit and its load
     report on host level also the internal usage, which the sys-
     tem keeps track of. The merge is done as follows:

     In general an attribute can be overridden on a lower level
        - global by hosts and queues
        - hosts by queues and load values or resource  limits  on
     the same level.

     We have one limitation for overriding  attributes  based  on
     its relational operator:

     !=, == operators can only be overridden on the  same  level,
     but  not  on  a  lower  level. The user defined value always
     overrides the load value.

     &gt;=, &gt;, &lt;=, &lt; operators can only be overridden, when the  new
     value is more restrictive than the old one.

     In the case of a consumable on host level, which has also  a
     load sensor, the system checks for the current usage, and if
     the internal accounting is more restrictive  than  the  load
     sensor  report, the internal value is kept; if the load sen-
     sor report is more restrictive, that one is kept.

     Note, Sun Grid Engine allows  backslashes  (\)  be  used  to
     escape  newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the
     newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any
     interpretation.

FORMAT
     The principal format of a <I>complex</I> configuration is that of a
     tabulated list. Each line starting with a '#' character is a
     comment line. Each line despite  comment  lines  define  one
     element  of  the complex. A element definition line consists
     of the following 8 column entries per line (in the order  of
     appearance):

  name
     The name of the complex element to be used to  request  this
     attribute  for  a  job  in  the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> -l option. A complex
     attribute name (see <I>complex</I>_<I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>) may appear
     only  once  across all complexes, i.e. the complex attribute
     definition is unique.

  shortcut
     A shortcut for name which may also be used to  request  this
     attribute  for  a job in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> -l option. An attribute
     shortcut may appear only once across all complexes, so as to
     avoid  the possibility of ambiguous complex attribute refer-
     ences.

  type
     This setting determines how the corresponding values are  to
     be treated Sun Grid Engine internally in case of comparisons
     or in case of load scaling for the load complex entries:

     <B>o</B>  With INT only raw integers are allowed.

     <B>o</B>  With DOUBLE floating point numbers  in  double  precision
        (decimal and scientific notation) can be specified.

     <B>o</B>  With  TIME  time  specifiers  are   allowed.   Refer   to
        <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for a format description.

     <B>o</B>  With MEMORY memory size specifiers are allowed. Refer  to
        <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for a format description.

     <B>o</B>  With BOOL the strings TRUE and FALSE  are  allowed.  When
        used in a load formula (refer to <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B> ) TRUE and
        FALSE get mapped into '1' and '0'.

     <B>o</B>  With STRING all strings are allowed and is used for wild-
        card  regular  boolean  expression  matching.  Please see
        <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B> manpage for expression definition.

        Examples:
         -l arch="*x24*|sol*"  :
              results in "arch=lx24-x86" OR "arch=lx24-amd64"
                 OR "arch=sol-sparc" OR "arch=sol-sparc64"
                 OR "arch=sol-x86" OR ...
         -l arch="sol-x??"  :
              results in "arch=sol-x86" OR "arch=sol-x64" OR ...
         -l arch="lx2[246]-x86"  :
              results in "arch=lx22-x86" OR "arch=lx24-x86"
                 OR "arch=lx26-x86"
         -l arch="lx2[4-6]-x86"  :
              results in "arch=lx24-x86" OR "arch=lx25-x86"
                 OR "arch=lx26-x86"
         -l arch="lx2[24-6]-x86"  :
              results in "arch=lx22-x86" OR "arch=lx24-x86"
                 OR "arch=lx25-x86" OR "arch=lx26-x86"
         -l arch="!lx24-x86&amp;!sol-sparc"  :
              results in NEITHER "arch=lx24-x86" NOR "arch=sol-sparc"
         -l arch="lx2[4|6]-x86"  :
              results in "arch=lx2[4" OR "arch=6"


     <B>o</B>  CSTRING is like STRING except comparisons are case insen-
        sitive.

     <B>o</B>  RESTRING is like STRING and it will be deprecated in  the
        future.

     <B>o</B>  HOST is like CSTRING but  the  expression  must  match  a
        valid hostname.

  relop
     The relation operator. The relation operator  is  used  when
     the  value  requested by the user for this parameter is com-
     pared against the corresponding  value  configured  for  the
     considered queues. If the result of the comparison is false,
     the job cannot run in this queue. Possible  relation  opera-
     tors  are  "==",  "&lt;",  "&gt;", "&lt;=", "&gt;=" and "EXCL". The only
     valid operator for string type attributes is "==".

     The "EXCL" relation operator implements exclusive scheduling
     and  is  only  valid for consumable boolean type attributes.
     Exclusive means the result of the comparison is only true if
     a  job  requests  to  be exclusive and no other exclusive or
     non-exclusive jobs uses the complex. If  the  job  does  not
     request  to be exclusive and no other exclusive job uses the
     complex the comparison is also true.

  requestable
     The entry can be used in a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> resource request if  this
     field  is  set  to 'y' or 'yes'.  If set to 'n' or 'no' this
     entry cannot be used by a user in order to request  a  queue
     or  a  class  of queues.  If the entry is set to 'forced' or
     'f' the attribute has to be requested by  a  job  or  it  is
     rejected.

     To enable resource request enforcement the existence of  the
     resource  has  to  be defined. This can be done on a cluster
     global, per host and per  queue  basis.  The  definition  of
     resource  availability  is performed with the complex_values
     entry in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">host_conf(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.


  consumable
     The consumable parameter can be set  to  either  'yes'  ('y'
     abbreviated),  'no'  ('n')  or 'JOB' ('j'). It can be set to
     'yes' and 'JOB' only for numeric  attributes  (INT,  DOUBLE,
     MEMORY, TIME - see type above). If set to 'yes' or 'JOB' the
     consumption of the corresponding resource can be managed  by
     Sun  Grid Engine internal bookkeeping. In this case Sun Grid
     Engine accounts for the consumption of this resource for all
     running  jobs  and  ensures that jobs are only dispatched if
     the Sun Grid Engine internal  bookkeeping  indicates  enough
     available consumable resources. Consumables are an efficient
     means to manage limited resources such a  available  memory,
     free  space  on a file system, network bandwidth or floating
     software licenses.

     A consumable defined by 'y' is a per slot consumables  which
     means  the  limit is multiplied by the number of slots being
     used by the job before being applied.  In case  of  'j'  the
     consumable is a per job consumable. This resource is debited
     as requested (without  multiplication)  from  the  allocated
     master  queue.  The  resource needs not be available for the
     slave task queues.

     Consumables can be combined with  default  or  user  defined
     load  parameters  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>  and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">host_conf(5)</A></B>), i.e.
     load values can be reported for consumable attributes or the
     consumable flag can be set for load attributes. The Sun Grid
     Engine consumable resource management takes  both  the  load
     (measuring  availability  of  the resource) and the internal
     bookkeeping into account in this case, and makes  sure  that
     neither of both exceeds a given limit.

     To enable consumable resource management the  basic  availa-
     bility  of a resource has to be defined. This can be done on
     a cluster global, per host and per queue basis  while  these
     categories may supersede each other in the given order (i.e.
     a host can restrict availability of a cluster resource and a
     queue  can restrict host and cluster resources). The defini-
     tion  of  resource  availability  is  performed   with   the
     complex_values entry in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">host_conf(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.  The
     complex_values definition of  the  "global"  host  specifies
     cluster  global consumable settings. To each consumable com-
     plex attribute in a complex_values list a value is  assigned
     which   denotes   the  maximum  available  amount  for  that
     resource. The internal bookkeeping will subtract  from  this
     total  the  assumed resource consumption by all running jobs
     as expressed through the jobs' resource requests.

     Note: Jobs can be forced to request a resource and  thus  to
     specify  their  assumed consumption via the 'force' value of
     the requestable parameter (see above).

     Note also: A default resource consumption value can be  pre-
     defined  by  the administrator for consumable attributes not
     explicitly requested by the job (see the  default  parameter
     below).  This is meaningful only if requesting the attribute
     is not enforced as explained above.

     See the <I>Sun</I> <I>Grid</I> <I>Engine</I> <I>Installation</I> <I>and</I> <I>Administration</I>  for
     examples on the usage of the consumable resources facility.

  default
     Meaningful only for consumable complex attributes (see  con-
     sumable  parameter  above).  Sun  Grid  Engine  assumes  the
     resource amount denoted in the default parameter  implicitly
     to  be  consumed by jobs being dispatched to a host or queue
     managing the consumable attribute. Jobs explicitly  request-
     ing the attribute via the -<I>l</I> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> override this
     default value.

  urgency
     The urgency value allows influencing job priorities on a per
     resource base. The urgency value effects the addend for each
     resource  when  determining  the  resource  request  related
     urgency contribution. For numeric type resource requests the
     addend is the product of the urgency value, the jobs assumed
     slot allocation and the per slot request as specified via -<I>l</I>
     option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>.  For string type requests  the  resources
     urgency value is directly used as addend. Urgency values are
     of type real. See under <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_priority.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_priority(5)</A></B> for an  overview  on
     job priorities.
