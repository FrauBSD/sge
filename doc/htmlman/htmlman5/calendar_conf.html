NAME
     calendar_conf - Sun Grid Engine calendar configuration  file
     format

DESCRIPTION
     <I>calendar</I>_<I>conf</I> reflects the format of  the  Sun  Grid  Engine
     calendar  configuration. The definition of calendars is used
     to specify "on duty" and "off duty"  time  periods  for  Sun
     Grid  Engine  queues on a time of day, day of week or day of
     year basis. Various calendars can  be  implemented  and  the
     appropriate  calendar definition for a certain class of jobs
     can be attached to a queue.

     <I>calendar</I>_<I>conf</I> entries can be added, modified  and  displayed
     with  the  -<I>Acal</I>,  -<I>acal</I>,  -<I>Mcal</I>,  -<I>mcal</I>,  -<I>scal</I>  and -<I>scall</I>
     options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B> or with the calendar configuration  dia-
     log of the graphical user interface <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmon(1)</A></B>.

     Note, Sun Grid Engine allows  backslashes  (\)  be  used  to
     escape  newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the
     newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any
     interpretation.

FORMAT
  calendar_name
     The name of the calendar to be used  when  attaching  it  to
     queues  or  when  administering the calendar definition. See
     <I>calendar</I>_<I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B> for a  precise  definition  of
     valid calendar names.

  year
     The queue status definition on a day of the year basis. This
     field  generally  will  specify on which days of a year (and
     optionally at which times on those days) a queue,  to  which
     the  calendar  is  attached, will change to a certain state.
     The syntax of the year field is defined as follows:

     year:=
         { NONE
         | year_day_range_list=daytime_range_list[=state]
         | year_day_range_list=[daytime_range_list=]state
         | state}

     Where

     <B>o</B>  NONE means, no definition is made on the year basis

     <B>o</B>  if a definition is made on the year basis, at  least  one
        of   year_day_range_list,  daytime_range_list  and  state
        always have to be present,

     <B>o</B>  all day long is assumed if daytime_range_list is omitted,
     <B>o</B>  switching the queue  to  "off"  (i.e.  disabling  it)  is
        assumed if state is omitted,

     <B>o</B>  the queue is assumed  to  be  enabled  for  days  neither
        referenced      implicitly      (by      omitting     the
        year_day_range_list) nor explicitly

     and the syntactical components are defined as follows:

       year_day_range_list := {yearday-yearday|yearday},...
       daytime_range_list :=  hour[:minute][:second]-
                              hour[:minute][:second],...
       state :=     {on|off|suspended}
       year_day :=  month_day.month.year
       month_day := {1|2|...|31}
       month :=     {jan|feb|...|dec|1|2|...|12}
       year :=      {1970|1971|...|2037}

  week
     The queue status definition on a day of the week basis. This
     field  generally  will  specify on which days of a week (and
     optionally at which times on those days) a queue,  to  which
     the  calendar  is  attached, will change to a certain state.
     The syntax of the week field is defined as follows:

     week:=
         { NONE
         | week_day_range_list[=daytime_range_list][=state]
         | [week_day_range_list=]daytime_range_list[=state]
         | [week_day_range_list=][daytime_range_list=]state} ...

     Where

     <B>o</B>  NONE means, no definition is made on the week basis

     <B>o</B>  if a definition is made on the week basis, at  least  one
        of   week_day_range_list,  daytime_range_list  and  state
        always have to be present,

     <B>o</B>  every day in the week is assumed  if  week_day_range_list
        is omitted,

     <B>o</B>  syntax and semantics of daytime_range_list and state  are
        identical  to  the  definition  given  for the year field
        above,

     <B>o</B>  the queue is assumed  to  be  enabled  for  days  neither
        referenced      implicitly      (by      omitting     the
        week_day_range_list) nor explicitly

     and where week_day_range_list is defined as

       week_day_range_list := {weekday-weekday|weekday},...
       week_day :=  {mon|tue|wed|thu|fri|sat|sun}

     with week_day ranges the week_day identifiers must  be  dif-
     ferent.

SEMANTICS
     Successive entries to the year and week fields (separated by
     blanks) are combined in compliance with the following rule:

     <B>o</B>  "off"-areas  are  overridden  by  overlapping  "on"-  and
        "suspended"-areas and "suspended"-areas are overridden by
        "on"-areas.

     Hence an entry of the form

       week  12-18 tue=13-17=on

     means that queues referencing the corresponding calendar are
     disabled the entire week from 12.00-18.00 with the exception
     of Tuesday between 13.00-17.00 where the queues  are  avail-
     able.


     <B>o</B>  Area overriding occurs only within a year/week basis.  If
        a year entry exists for a day then only the year calendar
        is taken into account and no area overriding is done with
        a possibly conflicting week area.


     <B>o</B>  the second time specification in a daytime_range_list may
        be  before the first one and treated as expected. Thus an
        entry of the form

          year  12.03.2004=12-11=off

        causes the queue(s) be disabled 12.03.2004 from  00:00:00
        - 10:59:59 and 12:00:00 - 23:59:59.

EXAMPLES
     (The following  examples  are  contained  in  the  directory
     $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/calendars).

     <B>o</B>  Night, weekend and public holiday calendar:

        On public holidays "night" queues are explicitly enabled.
        On  working  days  queues  are  disabled between 6.00 and
        20.00. Saturday and  Sunday  are  implicitly  handled  as
        enabled times:

          calendar_name  night
          year           1.1.1999,6.1.1999,28.3.1999,30.3.1999-
          31.3.1999,18.5.1999-19.5.1999,3.10.1999,25.12.1999,26
          .12.1999=on
          week           mon-fri=6-20


     <B>o</B>  Day calendar:

        On public holidays "day"-queues are disabled. On  working
        days  such  queues  are  closed  during the night between
        20.00 and 6.00, i.e. the queues are also closed on Monday
        from  0.00  to 6.00 and on Friday from 20.00 to 24.00. On
        Saturday and Sunday the queues are disabled.

          calendar_name  day
          year           1.1.1999,6.1.1999,28.3.1999,30.3.1999-
          31.3.1999,18.5.1999-19.5.1999,3.10.1999,25.12.1999,26
          .12.1999
          week           mon-fri=20-6 sat-sun


     <B>o</B>  Night, weekend and public holiday calendar  with  suspen-
        sion:

        Essentially the same scenario as the  first  example  but
        queues are suspended instead of switching them "off".

          calendar_name  night_s
          year           1.1.1999,6.1.1999,28.3.1999,30.3.1999-
          31.3.1999,18.5.1999-19.5.1999,3.10.1999,25.12.1999,26
          .12.1999=on
          week           mon-fri=6-20=suspended


     <B>o</B>  Day calendar with suspension:

        Essentially the same scenario as the second  example  but
        queues are suspended instead of switching them "off".

          calendar_name  day_s
          year           1.1.1999,6.1.1999,28.3.1999,30.3.1999-
          31.3.1999,18.5.1999-19.5.1999,3.10.1999,25.12.1999,26
          .12.1999=suspended
          week           mon-fri=20-6=suspended sat-sun=suspended


     <B>o</B>  Weekend calendar with suspension, ignoring  public  holi-
        days:

        Settings are only done on the week basis, no settings  on
        the year basis (keyword "NONE").

          calendar_name  weekend_s
          year           NONE
          week           sat-sun=suspended
