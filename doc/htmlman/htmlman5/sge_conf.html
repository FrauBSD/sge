NAME
     sge_conf - Sun Grid Engine configuration files

DESCRIPTION
     <I>sge</I>_<I>conf</I> defines the global and local Sun Grid Engine confi-
     gurations  and  can  be shown/modified by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B> using the
     -sconf/-mconf options. Only root or the cluster  administra-
     tor may modify <I>sge</I>_<I>conf</I>.

     At its initial start-up, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> checks to see  if  a
     valid  Sun  Grid Engine configuration is available at a well
     known location in the Sun  Grid  Engine  internal  directory
     hierarchy.   If  so, it loads that configuration information
     and proceeds.  If not, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> writes a generic  con-
     figuration  containing default values to that same location.
     The Sun Grid  Engine  execution  daemons  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  upon
     start-up retrieve their configuration from <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

     The  actual  configuration  for  both   <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>   and
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  is  a  superposition of a <I>global</I> configuration
     and a <I>local</I> configuration pertinent for the host on which  a
     master  or  execution daemon resides.  If a local configura-
     tion is available, its entries overwrite  the  corresponding
     entries  of the global configuration. Note: The local confi-
     guration does not have to contain  all  valid  configuration
     entries,  but  only  those which need to be modified against
     the global entries.

     Note: Sun Grid Engine allows  backslashes  (\)  be  used  to
     escape  newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the
     newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any
     interpretation.

FORMAT
     The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of the
     individual parameters that compose the global and local con-
     figurations for a Sun Grid Engine cluster:

  execd_spool_dir
     The execution daemon spool directory path. Again, a feasible
     spool  directory  requires  read/write access permission for
     root. The entry in the global configuration for this parame-
     ter  can  be  overwritten by execution host local configura-
     tions, i.e. each  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  may  have  a  private  spool
     directory  with  a different path, in which case it needs to
     provide read/write permission for the root  account  of  the
     corresponding execution host only.

     Under execd_spool_dir a directory named corresponding to the
     unqualified  hostname  of  the  execution host is opened and
     contains all information spooled to disk. Thus, it is possi-
     ble  for  the  execd_spool_dirs  of  all  execution hosts to
     physically reference  the  same  directory  path  (the  root
     access  restrictions  mentioned  above  need to be met, how-
     ever).

     Changing the global execd_spool_dir parameter set at instal-
     lation  time  is  not  supported in a running system. If the
     change should still be done it is required  to  restart  all
     affected  execution  daemons.  Please make sure running jobs
     have finished before doing so, otherwise running  jobs  will
     be lost.


     The default location for the execution daemon  spool  direc-
     tory is $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/spool.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

  mailer
     mailer is the  absolute  pathname  to  the  electronic  mail
     delivery  agent on your system. It must accept the following
     syntax:

          mailer -s &lt;subject-of-mail-message&gt; &lt;recipient&gt;

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a  private  mail  agent.  Changing
     mailer will take immediate effect.

     The default for mailer depends on the  operating  system  of
     the  host  on  which the Sun Grid Engine master installation
     was run. Common values are /bin/mail or /usr/bin/Mail.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

  xterm
     xterm is the absolute pathname to the X Window System termi-
     nal emulator, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">xterm(1)</A></B>.

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a  private  mail  agent.  Changing
     xterm will take immediate effect.

     The default for xterm is /usr/bin/X11/xterm.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

  load_sensor
     A comma separated list of executable shell script  paths  or
     programs  to  be  started  by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> and to be used in
     order to retrieve site configurable load  information  (e.g.
     free space on a certain disk partition).
     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a set of private load_sensor  pro-
     grams  or  scripts.  Changing  load_sensor  will take effect
     after two load report intervals  (see  load_report_time).  A
     load  sensor  will  be  restarted  automatically if the file
     modification time of the load sensor executable changes.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     In addition to the load sensors configured via  load_sensor,
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_exec.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_exec(8)</A></B>  searches for an executable file named <I>qloadsen-</I>
     <I>sor</I> in the execution host's Sun Grid Engine binary directory
     path.   If such a file is found, it is treated like the con-
     figurable load sensors defined in load_sensor. This facility
     is intended for pre-installing a default load sensor.

  prolog
     The executable path of a shell script that is started before
     execution  of Sun Grid Engine jobs with the same environment
     setting as that for the Sun Grid Engine jobs to  be  started
     afterwards.  An  optional  prefix "user@" specifies the user
     under which this procedure is to be started. The  procedures
     standard  output  and the error output stream are written to
     the same file used also for the standard  output  and  error
     output  of  each job.  This procedure is intended as a means
     for the Sun Grid Engine administrator to automate the execu-
     tion  of general site specific tasks like the preparation of
     temporary file systems with the need for  the  same  context
     information as the job.  Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a private
     prolog script. Correspondingly,  the  execution  host  local
     configurations is can be overwritten by the queue configura-
     tion (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B> ). Changing prolog will take immedi-
     ate effect.

     The default for prolog is  the  special  value  NONE,  which
     prevents from execution of a prolog script.

     The following special variables expanded at runtime  can  be
     used (besides any other strings which have to be interpreted
     by the procedure) to constitute a command line:

     $<I>host</I>
          The name of the host on which the prolog or epilog pro-
          cedures are started.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>owner</I>
          The user name of the job owner.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>
          Sun Grid Engine's unique job identification number.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>name</I>
          The name of the job.

     $<I>processors</I>
          The processors string as contained in the queue  confi-
          guration  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) of the master queue (the
          queue in which the prolog  and  epilog  procedures  are
          started).

     $<I>queue</I>
          The cluster queue name of the  master  queue  instance,
          i.e.  the  cluster queue in which the prolog and epilog
          procedures are started.

     $<I>stdin</I>_<I>path</I>
          The  pathname  of  the  stdin  file.  This  is   always
          /dev/null  for prolog, pe_start, pe_stop and epilog. It
          is the pathname of the stdin file for the  job  in  the
          job  script.  When  delegated  file staging is enabled,
          this path is set to $fs_stdin_tmp_path. When  delegated
          file  staging  is not enabled, it is the stdin pathname
          given via DRMAA or qsub.

     $<I>stdout</I>_<I>path</I>

     $<I>stderr</I>_<I>path</I>
          The pathname of the  stdout/stderr  file.  This  always
          points  to  the  output/error file. When delegated file
          staging   is   enabled,   this   path   is    set    to
          $fs_stdout_tmp_path/$fs_stderr_tmp_path. When delegated
          file staging is not enabled, it  is  the  stdout/stderr
          pathname given via DRMAA or qsub.

     $<I>merge</I>_<I>stderr</I>
          If merging of stderr and stdout is requested, this flag
          is "1", otherwise it is "0".  If this flag is 1, stdout
          and stderr are merged in one  file,  the  stdout  file.
          Merging  of  stderr and stdout can be requested via the
          DRMAA job template  attribute  'drmaa_join_files'  (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_attributes.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">drmaa_attributes(3)</A></B> ) or the qsub parameter '-j y' (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> ).

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdin</I>_<I>host</I>
          When delegated file staging is requested for the  stdin
          file, this is the name of the host where the stdin file
          has to be copied from before the job is started.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdout</I>_<I>host</I>

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stderr</I>_<I>host</I>
          When  delegated  file  staging  is  requested  for  the
          stdout/stderr  file, this is the name of the host where
          the stdout/stderr file has to be copied  to  after  the
          job has run.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdin</I>_<I>path</I>
          When delegated file staging is requested for the  stdin
          file,  this  is  the  pathname of the stdin file on the
          host $fs_stdin_host.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdout</I>_<I>path</I>

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stderr</I>_<I>path</I>
          When  delegated  file  staging  is  requested  for  the
          stdout/stderr   file,  this  is  the  pathname  of  the
          stdout/stderr       file       on       the        host
          $fs_stdout_host/$fs_stderr_host.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdin</I>_<I>tmp</I>_<I>path</I>
          When delegated file staging is requested for the  stdin
          file,  this  is  the  destination pathname of the stdin
          file on the execution host. The prolog script must copy
          the  stdin  file  from $fs_stdin_host:$fs_stdin_path to
          localhost:$fs_stdin_tmp_path  to  establish   delegated
          file staging of the stdin file.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdout</I>_<I>tmp</I>_<I>path</I>

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stderr</I>_<I>tmp</I>_<I>path</I>
          When  delegated  file  staging  is  requested  for  the
          stdout/stderr  file, this is the source pathname of the
          stdout/stderr file on the execution  host.  The  epilog
          script    must    copy    the    stdout    file    from
          localhost:$fs_stdout_tmp_path                        to
          $fs_stdout_host:$fs_stdout_path  (the  stderr file from
          localhost:$fs_stderr_tmp_path                        to
          $fs_stderr_host:$fs_stderr_path) to establish delegated
          file staging of the stdout/stderr file.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdin</I>_<I>file</I>_<I>staging</I>

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdout</I>_<I>file</I>_<I>staging</I>

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stderr</I>_<I>file</I>_<I>staging</I>
          When  delegated  file  staging  is  requested  for  the
          stdin/stdout/stderr  file, the flag is set to "1", oth-
          erwise it is set to "0" (see in  delegated_file_staging
          how to enable delegated file staging).

          These three flags correspond to the DRMAA job  template
          attribute          'drmaa_transfer_files'          (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_attributes.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">drmaa_attributes(3)</A></B> ).

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.
     Exit codes for the prolog attribute can be interpreted based
     on the following exit values:
          0: Success
          99: Reschedule job
          100: Put job in error state
          Anything else: Put queue in error state

  epilog
     The executable path of a shell script that is started  after
     execution  of Sun Grid Engine jobs with the same environment
     setting as that for the Sun Grid Engine jobs that  has  just
     completed.  An  optional  prefix  "user@" specifies the user
     under which this procedure is to be started. The  procedures
     standard  output  and the error output stream are written to
     the same file used also for the standard  output  and  error
     output  of  each job.  This procedure is intended as a means
     for the Sun Grid Engine administrator to automate the execu-
     tion  of general site specific tasks like the cleaning up of
     temporary file systems with the need for  the  same  context
     information as the job.  Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a private
     epilog script. Correspondingly,  the  execution  host  local
     configurations is can be overwritten by the queue configura-
     tion  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>  ).   Changing  epilog  will  take
     immediate effect.

     The default for epilog is  the  special  value  NONE,  which
     prevents from execution of a epilog script.  The  same  spe-
     cial variables as for prolog can be  used  to  constitute  a
     command line.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     Exit codes for the epilog attribute can be interpreted based
     on the following exit values:
          0: Success
          99: Reschedule job
          100: Put job in error state
          Anything else: Put queue in error state

  shell_start_mode
     Note: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
     This parameter defines the  mechanisms  which  are  used  to
     actually  invoke the job scripts on the execution hosts. The
     following values are recognized:

     <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I>
          If a user starts a job shell script under UNIX interac-
          tively  by  invoking  it  just with the script name the
          operating system's executable loader uses the  informa-
          tion  provided in a comment such as `#!/bin/csh' in the
          first line  of  the  script  to  detect  which  command
          interpreter  to  start  to  interpret  the script. This
          mechanism is used by Sun Grid Engine when starting jobs
          if <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I> is defined as shell_start_mode.

     <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>
          POSIX does not consider first script line comments such
          a  `#!/bin/csh'  as significant. The POSIX standard for
          batch queuing systems (P1003.2d) therefore  requires  a
          compliant  queuing  system  to ignore such lines but to
          use user specified or configured default command inter-
          preters  instead.  Thus,  if shell_start_mode is set to
          <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I> Sun Grid Engine  will  either  use  the
          command  interpreter  indicated by the -S option of the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> command or the shell parameter of the queue  to
          be used (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).

     <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I>
          Setting  the  shell_start_mode  parameter   either   to
          <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>  or  <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I>  requires you to set
          the umask in use for <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> such that every  user
          has  read  access  to  the active_jobs directory in the
          spool directory of the corresponding execution  daemon.
          In  case you have prolog and epilog scripts configured,
          they also need to be readable by any user who may  exe-
          cute jobs.
          If this violates your site's security policies you  may
          want to set shell_start_mode to <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I>. This
          will force Sun Grid Engine to open the  job  script  as
          well  as the epilog and prolog scripts for reading into
          STDIN as root (if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  was  started  as  root)
          before  changing  to the job owner's user account.  The
          script is then fed into the STDIN stream of the command
          interpreter  indicated  by the -S option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>
          command or the shell parameter of the queue to be  used
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).
          Thus setting shell_start_mode to <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I> also
          implies  <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>  behavior. Note, however, that
          feeding scripts into the  STDIN  stream  of  a  command
          interpreter  may  cause trouble if commands like <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">rsh(1)</A></B>
          are invoked inside a job script as  they  also  process
          the  STDIN  stream  of  the  command interpreter. These
          problems can usually be  resolved  by  redirecting  the
          STDIN  channel of those commands to come from /dev/null
          (e.g. rsh host date &lt; /dev/null). Note also,  that  any
          command-line options associated with the job are passed
          to the executing shell. The  shell  will  only  forward
          them  to  the  job  if they are not recognized as valid
          shell options.

     Changes to shell_start_mode will take immediate effect.  The
     default for shell_start_mode is <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  login_shells
     UNIX command interpreters like the Bourne-Shell (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sh(1)</A></B>)
     or  the  C-Shell (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">csh(1)</A></B>) can be used by Sun Grid Engine
     to start job scripts. The command interpreters can either be
     started  as  login-shells  (i.e. all system and user default
     resource files like .login or .profile will be executed when
     the  command  interpreter is started and the environment for
     the job will be set up as if the user has just logged in) or
     just   for  command  execution  (i.e.  only  shell  specific
     resource files like .cshrc will be executed  and  a  minimal
     default  environment  is  set  up  by  Sun Grid Engine - see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>).   The  parameter  login_shells  contains  a  comma
     separated list of the executable names of the command inter-
     preters to be started as login-shells.  Shells in this  list
     are   only   started   as  login  shells  if  the  parameter
     shell_start_mode (see above) is set to <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>.

     Changes to login_shells will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for login_shells is sh,csh,tcsh,ksh.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  min_uid
     min_uid places a lower bound on user IDs that  may  use  the
     cluster. Users whose user ID (as returned by <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/getpwnam.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">getpwnam(3)</A></B>) is
     less than min_uid will not be allowed to  run  jobs  on  the
     cluster.

     Changes to min_uid will take immediate effect.  The  default
     for min_uid is 0.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  min_gid
     This parameter sets the lower bound on group  IDs  that  may
     use  the cluster.  Users whose default group ID (as returned
     by <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/getpwnam.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">getpwnam(3)</A></B>) is less than min_gid will not be allowed  to
     run jobs on the cluster.

     Changes to min_gid will take immediate effect.  The  default
     for min_gid is 0.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not   be   overwritten   by   the   execution   host   local
     configuration.

  user_lists
     The user_lists parameter contains a comma separated list  of
     user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user
     contained in at least one of the enlisted access  lists  has
     access to the cluster. If the user_lists parameter is set to
     NONE (the  default)  any  user  has  access  not  explicitly
     excluded  via the xuser_lists parameter described below.  If
     a user is contained both  in  an  access  list  enlisted  in
     xuser_lists  and user_lists the user is denied access to the
     cluster.

     Changes to user_lists will take immediate effect

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  xuser_lists
     The xuser_lists parameter contains a comma separated list of
     user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user
     contained in at least one of the enlisted  access  lists  is
     denied  access  to the cluster. If the xuser_lists parameter
     is set to NONE (the default) any user has access.  If a user
     is  contained both in an access list enlisted in xuser_lists
     and user_lists (see above) the user is denied access to  the
     cluster.

     Changes to xuser_lists will take immediate effect

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  administrator_mail
     administrator_mail specifies a comma separated list  of  the
     electronic  mail address(es) of the cluster administrator(s)
     to whom internally-generated problem reports are  sent.  The
     mail  address  format depends on your electronic mail system
     and how it is configured; consult your  system's  configura-
     tion guide for more information.

     Changing administrator_mail  takes  immediate  effect.   The
     default for administrator_mail is an empty mail list.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  projects

     The projects list contains all projects  which  are  granted
     access  to  Sun Grid Engine. User belonging to none of these
     projects cannot use Sun Grid Engine. If users belong to pro-
     jects  in  the  projects  list  and  the xprojects list (see
     below), they also cannot use the system.

     Changing projects takes immediate effect.  The  default  for
     projects is none.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  xprojects
     The xprojects list contains all  projects  that  are  denied
     access  to  Sun  Grid Engine. User belonging to one of these
     projects cannot use Sun Grid Engine. If users belong to pro-
     jects  in  the  projects  list (see above) and the xprojects
     list, they also cannot use the system.

     Changing xprojects takes immediate effect.  The default  for
     xprojects is none.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  load_report_time
     System load is reported periodically by the  execution  dae-
     mons  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.   The  parameter  load_report_time
     defines the time interval between load reports.

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use  a  different  load  report  time.
     Changing load_report_time will take immediate effect.

     Note: Be careful when modifying load_report_time.  Reporting
     load too frequently might block <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> especially if
     the number of execution hosts is large. Moreover, since  the
     system load typically increases and decreases smoothly, fre-
     quent load reports hardly offer any benefit.

     The default for load_report_time is 40 seconds.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

  reschedule_unknown
     Determines whether  jobs  on  hosts  in  unknown  state  are
     rescheduled   and  thus  sent  to  other  hosts.  Hosts  are
     registered as unknown if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_master.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_master(8)</A></B> cannot establish con-
     tact  to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on those hosts (see max_unheard ).
     Likely reasons are a breakdown of the host or a breakdown of
     the network connection in between, but also <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may
     not be executing on such hosts.

     In any case, Sun Grid Engine can reschedule jobs running  on
     such  hosts  to another system.  reschedule_unknown controls
     the time which Sun Grid Engine will  wait  before  jobs  are
     rescheduled  after  a  host  became unknown. The time format
     specification is hh:mm:ss. If the special value 00:00:00  is
     set, then jobs will not be rescheduled from this host.

     Rescheduling is only initiated for jobs which have activated
     the rerun flag (see the -r y option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> and the rerun
     option  of   <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).    Parallel   jobs   are   only
     rescheduled  if the host on which their master task executes
     is in unknown state. The behavior of reschedule_unknown  for
     parallel jobs and for jobs without the rerun flag be set can
     be    adjusted    using    the    qmaster_params    settings
     ENABLE_RESCHEDULE_KILL and ENABLE_RESCHEDULE_SLAVE.

     Checkpointing jobs will only be rescheduled  when  the  when
     option  of  the corresponding checkpointing environment con-
     tains an appropriate flag. (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">checkpoint(5)</A></B>).  Interactive
     jobs (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtcsh(1)</A></B>) are not rescheduled.

     The default for reschedule_unknown is 00:00:00

     The global configuration entry for this value  may  be  over
     written by the execution host local configuration.

  max_unheard
     If <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> could not contact or was not contacted  by
     the  execution daemon of a host for max_unheard seconds, all
     queues residing on that particular host are  set  to  status
     unknown.   <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>,  at least, should be contacted by
     the execution daemons in order  to  get  the  load  reports.
     Thus,    max_unheard    should    by    greater   than   the
     load_report_time (see above).

     Changing max_unheard takes immediate  effect.   The  default
     for max_unheard is 5 minutes.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  loglevel
     This parameter specifies the level of detail that  Sun  Grid
     Engine components such as <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> use
     to produce informative, warning or error messages which  are
     logged  to  the  <I>messages</I>  files in the master and execution
     daemon  spool  directories  (see  the  description  of   the
     execd_spool_dir  parameter  above).  The  following  message
     levels are available:

     <I>log</I>_<I>err</I>
          All error events being recognized are logged.

     <I>log</I>_<I>warning</I>
          All error events  being  recognized  and  all  detected
          signs of potentially erroneous behavior are logged.

     <I>log</I>_<I>info</I>
          All error events being recognized, all  detected  signs
          of  potentially  erroneous  behavior  and  a variety of
          informative messages are logged.

     Changing loglevel will take immediate effect.

     The default for loglevel is <I>log</I>_<I>warning</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  max_aj_instances
     This parameter defines the maximum amount of array  task  to
     be  scheduled  to  run  simultaneously  per  array  job.  An
     instance of an array task will be created within the  master
     daemon  when  it  gets a start order from the scheduler. The
     instance will be destroyed when  the  array  task  finishes.
     Thus  the  parameter provides control mainly over the memory
     consumption of array jobs in the master and  scheduler  dae-
     mon.  It  is  most  useful  for very large clusters and very
     large array jobs.  The default for this parameter  is  2000.
     The  value  0  will deactivate this limit and will allow the
     scheduler to start as  many  array  job  tasks  as  suitable
     resources are available in the cluster.

     Changing max_aj_instances will take immediate effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  max_aj_tasks
     This parameter defines the maximum number of array job tasks
     within  an  array job.  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> will reject all array
     job submissions which request more than  max_aj_tasks  array
     job  tasks.  The  default  for  this parameter is 75000. The
     value 0 will deactivate this limit.

     Changing max_aj_tasks will take immediate effect.


     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  max_u_jobs
     The number of active (not finished) jobs which each Sun Grid
     Engine  user  can  have in the system simultaneously is con-
     trolled by this parameter. A value greater  than  0  defines
     the  limit.  The  default  value 0 means "unlimited". If the
     max_u_jobs limit is exceeded by a job  submission  then  the
     submission   command  exits  with  exit  status  25  and  an
     appropriate error message.

     Changing max_u_jobs will take immediate effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  max_jobs
     The number of  active  (not  finished)  jobs  simultaneously
     allowed  in Sun Grid Engine is controlled by this parameter.
     A value greater than 0 defines the limit. The default  value
     0  means "unlimited". If the max_jobs limit is exceeded by a
     job submission then the submission command exits  with  exit
     status 25 and an appropriate error message.

     Changing max_jobs will take immediate effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  max_advance_reservations
     The number of active  (not  finished)  Advance  Reservations
     simultaneously  allowed  in Sun Grid Engine is controlled by
     this parameter. A value greater than 0  defines  the  limit.
     The    default   value   0   means   "unlimited".   If   the
     max_advance_reservations limit is  exceeded  by  an  Advance
     Reservation  request  then the submission command exits with
     exit status 25 and an appropriate error message.

     Changing  max_advance_reservations   will   take   immediate
     effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  enforce_project
     If set to <I>true</I>, users are  required  to  request  a  project
     whenever  submitting a job. See the -P option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> for
     details.

     Changing enforce_project will take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for enforce_project is <I>false</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  enforce_user
     If set to <I>true</I>, a <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B> must exist to allow for  job  sub-
     mission. Jobs are rejected if no corresponding user exists.

     If set to <I>auto</I>, a <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B> object  for  the  submitting  user
     will  automatically be created during job submission, if one
     does   not    already    exist.    The    auto_user_oticket,
     auto_user_fshare,       auto_user_default_project,       and
     auto_user_delete_time configuration parameters will be  used
     as default attributes of the new <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B> object.

     Changing  enforce_user  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for enforce_user is <I>auto</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  auto_user_oticket
     The number of override tickets to  assign  to  automatically
     created  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B> objects. User objects are created automati-
     cally if the enforce_user attribute is set to <I>auto</I>.

     Changing auto_user_oticket will  affect  any  newly  created
     user  objects,  but  will not change user objects created in
     the past.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  auto_user_fshare
     The number of functional shares to assign  to  automatically
     created  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B> objects. User objects are created automati-
     cally if the enforce_user attribute is set to <I>auto</I>.

     Changing auto_user_fshare will affect any newly created user
     objects,  but  will  not  change user objects created in the
     past.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  auto_user_default_project
     The default  project  to  assign  to  automatically  created
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B>  objects.  User objects are created automatically if
     the enforce_user attribute is set to <I>auto</I>.

     Changing auto_user_default_project  will  affect  any  newly
     created  user  objects,  but  will  not  change user objects
     created in the past.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  auto_user_delete_time
     The number of seconds of inactivity  after  which  automati-
     cally  created <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B> objects will be deleted. User objects
     are created automatically if the enforce_user  attribute  is
     set  to  <I>auto</I>. If the user has no active or pending jobs for
     the specified amount of time, the object will  automatically
     be  deleted.   A value of 0 can be used to indicate that the
     automatically created user object is  permanent  and  should
     not be automatically deleted.

     Changing auto_user_delete_time will affect the deletion time
     for all users with active jobs.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  set_token_cmd
     Note: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
     This parameter is only present if your Sun Grid Engine  sys-
     tem is licensed to support AFS.

     Set_token_cmd points to a command which sets and extends AFS
     tokens  for  Sun  Grid Engine jobs. In the standard Sun Grid
     Engine AFS distribution, it is supplied as  a  script  which
     expects two command line parameters. It reads the token from
     STDIN, extends the token's  expiration  time  and  sets  the
     token:

          &lt;set_token_cmd&gt; &lt;user&gt; &lt;token_extend_after_seconds&gt;

     As a shell script this command will call the programs:

          - SetToken
          - forge

     which are provided by your distributor as source  code.  The
     script looks as follows:

          --------------------------------
          #!/bin/sh
          # set_token_cmd
          forge -u $1 -t $2 | SetToken
          --------------------------------

     Since it is necessary for  <I>forge</I>  to  read  the  secret  AFS
     server  key,  a site might wish to replace the set_token_cmd
     script by a command, which connects to a  custom  daemon  at
     the  AFS  server. The token must be forged at the AFS server
     and returned to the local machine, where  <I>SetToken</I>  is  exe-
     cuted.

     Changing set_token_cmd  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for set_token_cmd is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

  pag_cmd
     Note: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
     This parameter is only present if your Sun Grid Engine  sys-
     tem is licensed to support AFS.

     The path to your <I>pagsh</I> is specified via this parameter.  The
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B>  process  and the job run in a <I>pagsh</I>. Please
     ask your AFS administrator for details.

     Changing pag_cmd will take immediate  effect.   The  default
     for pag_cmd is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

  token_extend_time
     Note: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
     This parameter is only present if your Sun Grid Engine  sys-
     tem is licensed to support AFS.

     The token_extend_time is  the  time  period  for  which  AFS
     tokens  are periodically extended. Sun Grid Engine will call
     the token extension 30  minutes  before  the  tokens  expire
     until jobs have finished and the corresponding tokens are no
     longer required.

     Changing token_extend_time will take immediate effect.   The
     default for token_extend_time is 24:0:0, i.e. 24 hours.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.


  shepherd_cmd
     Alternative path to the shepherd_cmd binary. Typically  used
     to call the shepherd binary by a wrapper script or command.

     Changing  shepherd_cmd  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for shepherd_cmd is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

  gid_range
     The gid_range is a comma separated list of range expressions
     of  the form n-m (n as well as m are integer numbers greater
     than 99), where m is an abbreviation for m-m. These  numbers
     are  used in <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> to identify processes belonging to
     the same job.

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a separate set up  group  ids  for
     this  purpose.   All number in the group id range have to be
     unused supplementary group ids  on  the  system,  where  the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is started.

     Changing gid_range will take immediate effect.  There is  no
     default for gid_range. The administrator will have to assign
     a value  for  gid_range  during  installation  of  Sun  Grid
     Engine.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

  qmaster_params
     A list of additional parameters can be  passed  to  the  Sun
     Grid Engine qmaster. The following values are recognized:

     <I>ENABLE</I>_<I>ENFORCE</I>_<I>MASTER</I>_<I>LIMIT</I>
          If this parameter is set then the s_rt, h_rt limit of a
          running   job   are   tested   and   executed   by  the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> when the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> where the  job  is
          in unknown state.

          After s_rt or h_rt limit of a job is expired  then  the
          master  daemon  will  wait  additional  time defined by
          DURATION_OFFSET (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B>).  If the  execution
          daemon  still  cannot be contacted when this additional
          time is elapsed, then the master daemon will force  the
          deletion of the job (see -f of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qdel(1)</A></B>).

          For jobs which will be deleted that way  an  accounting
          record  will  be created. As usage the record will con-
          tain the last reported online usage, when the execution
          daemon  could  contact qmaster. The failed state in the
          record will be set to 37 to indicate that the  job  was
          terminated by a limit enforcement of master daemon.

          After the restart of <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> the limit  enforce-
          ment will at first be triggered after the double of the
          biggest  load_report_interval   interval   defined   in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B> has been elapsed. This will give the execu-
          tion daemons enough time to reregister at  master  dae-
          mon.

     <I>ENABLE</I>_<I>FORCED</I>_<I>QDEL</I>_<I>IF</I>_<I>UNKNOWN</I>
          If this parameter is set then a deletion request for  a
          job  is  automatically interpreted as a forced deletion
          request (see -f of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qdel(1)</A></B>) if the host, where the  job
          is running is in unknown state.

     <I>ENABLE</I>_<I>FORCED</I>_<I>QDEL</I>
          If this parameter is set, non-administrative users  can
          force  deletion  of their own jobs via the -<I>f</I> option of
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qdel(1)</A></B>.  Without this parameter,  forced  deletion  of
          jobs  is only allowed by the Sun Grid Engine manager or
          operator.

          Note: Forced deletion for jobs is executed  differently
          depending on whether users are Sun Grid Engine adminis-
          trators or not. In case of  administrative  users,  the
          jobs are removed from the internal database of Sun Grid
          Engine immediately. For regular users,  the  equivalent
          of  a normal <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qdel(1)</A></B> is executed first, and deletion is
          forced only if the normal cancellation  was  unsuccess-
          ful.

     <I>FORBID</I>_<I>RESCHEDULE</I>
          If this parameter is set, re-queuing of jobs cannot  be
          initiated  by  the job script which is under control of
          the user. Without this  parameter  jobs  returning  the
          value 99 are rescheduled. This can be used to cause the
          job  to  be  restarted  at  a  different  machine,  for
          instance  if  there  are  not  enough  resources on the
          current one.

     <I>FORBID</I>_<I>APPERROR</I>
          If this parameter is set, the  application  cannot  set
          itself  to  error  state.   Without this parameter jobs
          returning the value 100 are set  to  error  state  (and
          therefore  can  be manually rescheduled by clearing the
          error state).  This can be used to set the job to error
          state  when  a starting condition of the application is
          not fulfilled before the application  itself  has  been
          started, or when a clean up procedure (e.g. in the epi-
          log) decides that it is necessary to run the job again,
          by  returning  100 in the prolog, pe_start, job script,
          pe_stop or epilog script.

     <I>DISABLE</I>_<I>AUTO</I>_<I>RESCHEDULING</I>
          Note: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
          If set to "true" or "1", the <I>reschedule</I>_<I>unknown</I> parame-
          ter is not taken into account.

     <I>ENABLE</I>_<I>RESCHEDULE</I>_<I>KILL</I>
          If set to "true" or "1", the <I>reschedule</I>_<I>unknown</I> parame-
          ter  affects  also  jobs  which have the rerun flag not
          activated (see the -r y option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> and the rerun
          option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>), but they are just finished as
          they can't be rescheduled.

     <I>ENABLE</I>_<I>RESCHEDULE</I>_<I>SLAVE</I>
          If set to "true" or "1" Sun Grid  Engine  triggers  job
          rescheduling  also  when the host where the slave tasks
          of a parallel job executes is in unknown state, if  the
          <I>reschedule</I>_<I>unknown</I> parameter is activated.

     <I>MAX</I>_<I>DYN</I>_<I>EC</I>
          Sets the max number of dynamic event clients  (as  used
          by  qsub  -sync  y  and  by  Sun  Grid Engine DRMAA API
          library sessions). The default is set to 99. The number
          of dynamic event clients should not be bigger than half
          of the number of file descriptors the system  has.  The
          number of file descriptors are shared among the connec-
          tions to all exec hosts, all event  clients,  and  file
          handles that the qmaster needs.

     <I>MONITOR</I>_<I>TIME</I>
          Specifies the time interval when the monitoring  infor-
          mation should be printed. The monitoring is disabled by
          default and can be enabled by specifying  an  interval.
          The monitoring is per thread and is written to the mes-
          sages file or displayed by the "qping -f" command  line
          tool. Example: MONITOR_TIME=0:0:10 generates and prints
          the  monitoring  information  approximately  every   10
          seconds. The specified time is a guideline only and not
          a fixed interval. The interval that is actually used is
          printed.   In  this example, the interval could be any-
          thing between 9 seconds and 20 seconds.

     <I>LOG</I>_<I>MONITOR</I>_<I>MESSAGE</I>
          Monitoring information  is  logged  into  the  messages
          files  by default. This information can be accessed via
          by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qping.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qping(1)</A></B>.  If monitoring is always enabled, the mes-
          sages  files  can become quite large.  This switch dis-
          ables logging into the messages files, making <I>qping</I>  -<I>f</I>
          the only source of monitoring data.

     <I>PROF</I>_<I>SIGNAL</I>
          Profiling provides the user with the possibility to get
          system  measurements.  This can be useful for debugging
          or optimization of the  system.  The  profiling  output
          will be done within the messages file.

          Enables the profiling for qmaster signal thread.  (e.g.
          PROF_SIGNAL=true)

     <I>PROF</I>_<I>WORKER</I>
          Enables  the  profiling  for  qmaster  worker  threads.
          (e.g. PROF_WORKER=true)

     <I>PROF</I>_<I>LISTENER</I>
          Enables the profiling  for  qmaster  listener  threads.
          (e.g. PROF_LISTENER=true)

     <I>PROF</I>_<I>DELIVER</I>
          Enables the profiling for qmaster event deliver thread.
          (e.g. PROF_DELIVER=true)

     <I>PROF</I>_<I>TEVENT</I>
          Enables the profiling for qmaster timed  event  thread.
          (e.g. PROF_TEVENT=true)

     Please note, that the cpu utime and stime  values  contained
     in the profiling output are not per thread cpu times.  These
     cpu usage statistics are per  process  statistics.   So  the
     printed  profiling values for cpu mean "cpu time consumed by
     sge_qmaster (all threads) while the reported profiling level
     was active".

     <I>STREE</I>_<I>SPOOL</I>_<I>INTERVAL</I>
          Sets the  time  interval  for  spooling  the  sharetree
          usage.  The  default  is  set  to 00:04:00. The setting
          accepts colon-separated string or seconds. There is  no
          setting  to  turn  the  sharetree  spooling  off. (e.g.
          STREE_SPOOL_INTERVAL=00:02:00)

     <I>MAX</I>_<I>JOB</I>_<I>DELETION</I>_<I>TIME</I>
          Sets the value of  how  long  the  qmaster  will  spend
          deleting  jobs.  After this time, the qmaster will con-
          tinue with other tasks and  schedule  the  deletion  of
          remaining  jobs at a later time. The default value is 3
          seconds, and will be used if no value is  entered.  The
          range  of  valid  values  is  &gt;  0  and  &lt;=  5.   (e.g.
          MAX_JOB_DELETION_TIME=1)

     <I>gdi</I>_<I>timeout</I>
          Sets how long  the  communication  will  wait  for  gdi
          send/receive  operations.   The default value is set to
          60 seconds. After this time, the communication  library
          will  retry,  if "gdi_retries" is configured, receiving
          the  gdi   request.   In   case   of   not   configured
          "gdi_retries" the communication will return with a "gdi
          receive failure" (e.g.  gdi_timeout=120  will  set  the
          timeout  time  to  120  sec) Configuring no gdi_timeout
          value, the value defaults to 60 sec.

     <I>gdi</I>_<I>retries</I>
          Sets how often the gdi receive call  will  be  repeated
          until the gdi receive error appears. The default is set
          to 0. In this case the call will be done 1 time with no
          retry.   Setting  the value to -1 the call will be done
          permanently. In combination with gdi_timeout  parameter
          it is possible to configure a system with eg. slow NFS,
          to make sure that all jobs will  be  submitted.   (e.g.
          gdi_retries=4)

     <I>cl</I>_<I>ping</I>
          Turns on/off a communication library ping. This parame-
          ter  will  create  additional debug output. This output
          shows information about the error  messages  which  are
          returned  by communication and it will give information
          about the application status of  the  qmaster.  eg,  if
          it's  unclear  what's the reason for gdi timeouts, this
          may show you some useful messages. The default value is
          false (off) (e.g cl_ping=false)

     <I>SCHEDULER</I>_<I>TIMEOUT</I>
          Setting this parameter allows the scheduler  GDI  event
          acknowledge  timeout  to  be  manually  configured to a
          specific value.  Currently  the  default  value  is  10
          minutes  with  the  default scheduler configuration and
          limited between 600 and 1200 seconds. Value is  limited
          only  in  case  of  default  value.  The  default value
          depends on the  current  scheduler  configuration.  The
          <I>SCHEDULER</I>_<I>TIMEOUT</I> value is specified in seconds.

     <I>jsv</I>_<I>timeout</I>
          This parameter measures the response time of the server
          JSV.  In the event that the response time of the JSV is
          longer than the  timeout  value  specified,  this  will
          cause  the  JSV to be re-started. The default value for
          the timeout is 10 seconds  and  if  modified,  must  be
          greater  than 0. If the timeout has been reach, the JSV
          will only try to  re-start  once,  if  the  timeout  is
          reached again an error will occur.

     <I>jsv</I>_<I>threshold</I>
          The threshold of a JSV is measured as the time it takes
          to  perform a server job verification. If this value is
          greater than the user defined value, it will cause log-
          ging to appear in the qmaster messages file at the INFO
          level. By setting this value to 0,  all  jobs  will  be
          logged  in  the  qmaster  messages  file. This value is
          specified in milliseconds and has a  default  value  of
          5000.

     Changing qmaster_params will take immediate  effect,  except
     gdi_timeout,  gdi_retries,  cl_ping,  these will take effect
     only for new connections.  The default for qmaster_params is
     none.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  execd_params
     This is used for passing additional parameters  to  the  Sun
     Grid  Engine  execution  daemon.  The  following  values are
     recognized:

     <I>ACCT</I>_<I>RESERVED</I>_<I>USAGE</I>
          If this  parameter  is  set  to  true,  the   usage  of
          reserved  resources  is used for the accounting entries
          cpu, mem and io instead of the measured usage.

     <I>ENABLE</I>_<I>WINDOMACC</I>
          If this  parameter  is  set  to  true,  Windows  Domain
          accounts  (WinDomAcc)  are used on Windows hosts. These
          accounts require the  use  of  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sgepasswd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sgepasswd(1)</A></B>  (see  also
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sgepasswd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sgepasswd(5)</A></B>).  If this parameter is set to false or is
          not set, local Windows  accounts  are  used.   On  non-
          Windows hosts, this parameter is ignored.

     <I>KEEP</I>_<I>ACTIVE</I>
          This value should only be set for  debugging  purposes.
          If  set  to  true, the execution daemon will not remove
          the spool directory maintained by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> for a
          job.

     <I>PTF</I>_<I>MIN</I>_<I>PRIORITY</I>, <I>PTF</I>_<I>MAX</I>_<I>PRIORITY</I>
          The maximum/minimum priority which Sun Grid Engine will
          assign to a job.  Typically this is a negative/positive
          value in the range of -20 (maximum) to 19 (minimum) for
          systems  which  allow  setting  of  priorities with the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/nice.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">nice(2)</A></B> system call. Other  systems  may  provide  dif-
          ferent ranges.
          The default priority range (varies from system to  sys-
          tem)  is installed either by removing the parameters or
          by setting a value of -999.
          See the "messages" file of the execution daemon for the
          predefined  default value on your hosts. The values are
          logged during the startup of the execution daemon.

     <I>PROF</I>_<I>EXECD</I>
          Enables the profiling for the execution daemon.   (e.g.
          PROF_EXECD=true)

     <I>NOTIFY</I>_<I>KILL</I>
          The parameter allows you  to  change  the  notification
          signal  for  the  signal SIGKILL (see -<I>notify</I> option of
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>).  The parameter either  accepts  signal  names
          (use  the  -<I>l</I>  option  of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">kill(1)</A></B>) or the special value
          <I>none</I>. If set to <I>none</I>, no notification  signal  will  be
          sent.  If  it  is set to <I>TERM</I>, for instance, or another
          signal name then this signal will be sent as  notifica-
          tion signal.

     <I>NOTIFY</I>_<I>SUSP</I>
          With this parameter it is possible to modify the notif-
          ication  signal  for  the  signal  SIGSTOP (see -<I>notify</I>
          parameter of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>).  The  parameter  either  accepts
          signal names (use the -<I>l</I> option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">kill(1)</A></B>) or the spe-
          cial value <I>none</I>. If set to <I>none</I>, no notification signal
          will  be  sent.  If it is set to <I>TSTP</I>, for instance, or
          another signal name then this signal will  be  sent  as
          notification signal.

     <I>SHARETREE</I>_<I>RESERVED</I>_<I>USAGE</I>
          Note: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
          If this parameter is set to true, the usage of reserved
          resources  is  taken for the Sun Grid Engine share tree
          consumption instead of measured usage.
          Note:  When  running  tightly  integrated   jobs   with
          <I>SHARETREE</I>_<I>RESERVED</I>_<I>USAGE</I>    set,    and   with   having
          <I>accounting</I>_<I>summary</I> enabled in the parallel environment,
          reserved usage will only be reported by the master task
          of the  parallel  job.   No  per  parallel  task  usage
          records  will  be sent from execd to qmaster, which can
          significantly reduce load on qmaster when running large
          tightly integrated parallel jobs.

     <I>USE</I>_<I>QSUB</I>_<I>GID</I>
          If this parameter is set to true, the primary group  id
          active  when  a job was submitted will be set to become
          the primary group id for job execution. If the  parame-
          ter is not set, the primary group id as defined for the
          job owner in the execution host <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/passwd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">passwd(5)</A></B> file is used.
          The feature is only available for  jobs  submitted  via
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmake(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtcsh(1)</A></B>.  Also, it only
          works for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B> jobs (and thus also for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtcsh(1)</A></B>  and
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmake(1)</A></B>) if rsh and rshd components are used which are
          provided with Sun Grid Engine (i.e., the rsh_daemon and
          rsh_command  parameters  may  not  be  changed from the
          default).

     <I>S</I>_<I>DESCRIPTORS</I>, <I>H</I>_<I>DESCRIPTORS</I>, <I>S</I>_<I>MAXPROC</I>, <I>H</I>_<I>MAXPROC</I>,

     <I>S</I>_<I>MEMORYLOCKED</I>, <I>H</I>_<I>MEMORYLOCKED</I>, <I>S</I>_<I>LOCKS</I>, <I>H</I>_<I>LOCKS</I>
          Specifies soft and hard resource limits as  implemented
          by  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">setrlimit(2)</A></B> system call. See this manual page
          on your system for more information.  These  parameters
          complete  the list of limits set by the RESOURCE LIMITS
          parameter of the queue configuration  as  described  in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.  Unlike the resource limits in the queue
          configuration, these resource limits are set for  every
          job  on  this  execution host. If a value is not speci-
          fied, the resource limit is inherited from  the  execu-
          tion   daemon  process.  Because  this  would  lead  to
          unpredicted results, if only one limit of a resource is
          set  (soft  or  hard), the corresponding other limit is
          set to the same value.
          <I>S</I>_<I>DESCRIPTORS</I> and <I>H</I>_<I>DESCRIPTORS</I>  specify  a  value  one
          greater  than  the  maximum file descriptor number that
          can be opened by any process of a job.
          <I>S</I>_<I>MAXPROC</I> and <I>H</I>_<I>MAXPROC</I> specify the maximum  number  of
          processes  that  can be created by the job user on this
          execution host
          <I>S</I>_<I>MEMORYLOCKED</I> and <I>H</I>_<I>MEMORYLOCKED</I> specify  the  maximum
          number  of  bytes  of virtual memory that may be locked
          into RAM.
          <I>S</I>_<I>LOCKS</I> and <I>H</I>_<I>LOCKS</I> specify the maximum number of  file
          locks any process of a job may establish.
          All of these values can be specified using  the  multi-
          plier letters k, K, m, M, g and G, see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B> for
          details.

     <I>INHERIT</I>_<I>ENV</I>
          This parameter indicates whether  the  shepherd  should
          allow the environment inherited by the execution daemon
          from the shell that started it to be inherited  by  the
          job it's starting.  When true, any environment variable
          that is set in the shell  which  starts  the  execution
          daemon at the time the execution daemon is started will
          be set in the environment of any jobs run by that  exe-
          cution  daemon,  unless  the  environment  variable  is
          explicitly overridden, such as PATH or LOGNAME.  If set
          to  false,  each  job  starts with only the environment
          variables that are explicitly passed on by  the  execu-
          tion  daemon,  such  as  PATH and LOGNAME.  The default
          value is true.

     <I>SET</I>_<I>LIB</I>_<I>PATH</I>
          This parameter tells the execution  daemon  whether  to
          add the Sun Grid Engine shared library directory to the
          library path of executed jobs.  If  set  to  true,  and
          INHERIT_ENV  is  also  set to true, the Sun Grid Engine
          shared library  directory  will  be  prepended  to  the
          library  path  which  is inherited from the shell which
          started the execution daemon.  If INHERIT_ENV is set to
          false,  the library path will contain only the Sun Grid
          Engine shared library directory.  If set to false,  and
          INHERIT_ENV  is  set to true, the library path exported
          to the job will be the one  inherited  from  the  shell
          which  started the execution daemon.  If INHERIT_ENV is
          also set to false, the  library  path  will  be  empty.
          After the execution daemon has set the library path, it
          may be further altered by the shell in which the job is
          executed,  or  by  the  job script itself.  The default
          value for SET_LIB_PATH is false.

     <I>ENABLE</I>_<I>ADDGRP</I>_<I>KILL</I>
          If this parameter is set then Sun Grid Engine uses  the
          supplementary group ids (see <I>gid</I>_<I>range</I>) to identify all
          processes which are to be  terminated  when  a  job  is
          deleted,  or  when  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> cleans up after job
          termination.

     <I>PDC</I>_<I>INTERVAL</I>
          This parameter defines the interval how often  the  PDC
          (Portable  Data Collector) is executed by the execution
          daemon.  The  PDC  is  responsible  for  enforcing  the
          resource  limits  s_cpu,  h_cpu, s_vmem and h_vmem (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) and job usage collection.  The parameter
          can  be set to a time_specifier (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(5)</A></B>) , to
          PER_LOAD_REPORT or to NEVER.

     <I>ENABLE</I>_<I>BINDING</I>
          If this parameter is set then Sun Grid  Engine  enables
          the  core binding module within the execution daemon to
          apply binding parameters that are specified during sub-
          mission  time  of  a job. This parameter is not set per
          default and therefore all binding  related  information
          will be ignored.  Find more information for job to core
          binding in the section -<I>binding</I> of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>.

     If this parameter is set to PER_LOAD_REPORT the PDC is trig-
     gered  in the same interval as load_report_time (see above).
     If this parameter is set to NEVER the PDC run is never trig-
     gered. The default is 1 second.
     Note: A PDC run is quite compute extensive may  degrade  the
     performance  of  the  running jobs. But if the PDC runs less
     often or never the online usage can be incomplete or totally
     missing (for example online usage of very short running jobs
     might be missing) and the resource limit enforcement is less
     accurate or would not happen if PDC is turned of completely.

     Changing execd_params will take effect  after  it  was  pro-
     pagated to the execution daemons. The propagation is done in
     one load report interval.  The default for  execd_params  is
     none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

  reporting_params
     Used to define the behavior of reporting modules in the  Sun
     Grid  Engine  qmaster. Changes to the reporting_params takes
     immediate effect.  The following values are recognized:

     <I>accounting</I>
          If this parameter is set to true, the  accounting  file
          is  written.   The  accounting file is prerequisite for
          using the qacct command.

     <I>reporting</I>
          If this parameter is set to true, the reporting file is
          written.   The reporting file contains data that can be
          used for monitoring and analysis, like job  accounting,
          job  log,  host  load and consumables, queue status and
          consumables  and  sharetree  configuration  and  usage.
          Attention:  Depending on the size and load of the clus-
          ter, the reporting file can become  quite  large.  Only
          activate  the reporting file if you have a process run-
          ning that will consume the reporting file!  See <I>report-</I>
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/ing.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">ing(5)</A></B>  for  further  information about format and con-
          tents of the reporting file.

     <I>flush</I>_<I>time</I>
          Contents of the reporting file are buffered in the  Sun
          Grid  Engine  qmaster  and flushed at a fixed interval.
          This interval can be  configured  with  the  <I>flush</I>_<I>time</I>
          parameter.  It is specified as a time value in the for-
          mat HH:MM:SS.  Sensible values range from a few seconds
          to  one  minute.  Setting  it too low may slow down the
          qmaster. Setting it too high will make the qmaster con-
          sume large amounts of memory for buffering data.

     <I>accounting</I>_<I>flush</I>_<I>time</I>
          Contents of the accounting file are buffered in the Sun
          Grid  Engine  qmaster  and flushed at a fixed interval.
          This   interval   can   be    configured    with    the
          <I>accounting</I>_<I>flush</I>_<I>time</I>  parameter.  It is specified as a
          time value in the  format  HH:MM:SS.   Sensible  values
          range  from a few seconds to one minute. Setting it too
          low may slow down the qmaster. Setting it too high will
          make  the  qmaster  consume large amounts of memory for
          buffering data.  Setting it to  00:00:00  will  disable
          accounting  data  buffering;  as  soon  as data is gen-
          erated, it will be written to the accounting file.   If
          this  parameter  is  not set, the accounting data flush
          interval will default to the value  of  the  <I>flush</I>_<I>time</I>
          parameter.

     <I>joblog</I>
          If this parameter is set to true,  the  reporting  file
          will  contain job logging information. See <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/reporting.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">reporting(5)</A></B>
          for more information about job logging.

     <I>sharelog</I>
          The Sun Grid Engine qmaster can dump information  about
          sharetree  configuration and use to the reporting file.
          The parameter <I>sharelog</I> sets an interval in which share-
          tree information will be dumped.  It is set in the for-
          mat HH:MM:SS. A value of  00:00:00  configures  qmaster
          not to dump sharetree information. Intervals of several
          minutes up to hours are sensible values for this param-
          eter.   See  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/reporting.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">reporting(5)</A></B> for further information about
          sharelog.

     <I>log</I>_<I>consumables</I>
          This parameter controls writing of consumable resources
          to     the     reporting    file.     When    set    to
          (log_consumables=true) information about all consumable
          resources (their current usage and their capacity) will
          be written to the reporting file, whenever a consumable
          resource  changes either in definition, or in capacity,
          or when the usage of  a  consumable  resource  changes.
          When  log_consumables  is  set to false (default), only
          those variables will be written to the reporting  file,
          that are configured in the report_variables in the exec
          host configuration, see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">host_conf(5)</A></B> for further infor-
          mation about report_variables.

  finished_jobs
     Note: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
     Sun Grid Engine stores a certain  number  of  <I>just</I>  <I>finished</I>
     jobs   to   provide  post  mortem  status  information.  The
     finished_jobs parameter defines the number of finished  jobs
     stored.  If  this maximum number is reached, the eldest fin-
     ished job will be discarded for every new job added  to  the
     finished job list.

     Changing finished_jobs  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for finished_jobs is 100.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

  qlogin_daemon
     This parameter specifies the mechanism that is to be started
     on  the  server side of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qlogin.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qlogin(1)</A></B> request. Usually this is
     the builtin mechanism. It's also possible  to  configure  an
     external  executable  by specifying the full qualified path-
     name, e.g. of the system's telnet daemon.

     Changing qlogin_daemon  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default value for qlogin_daemon is builtin.
     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     Examples for the two allowed kinds of attributes are:
     qlogin_daemon    builtin
     or
     qlogin_daemon    /usr/sbin/in.telnetd

  qlogin_command
     This is the command to be executed on the client side  of  a
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qlogin.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qlogin(1)</A></B>  request.   Usually  this  is  the  builtin qlogin
     mechanism.  It's also  possible  to  configure  an  external
     mechanism,  usually  the  absolute  pathname of the system's
     telnet client program. It is automatically started with  the
     target host and port number as parameters.

     Changing qlogin_command will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default value for qlogin_command is builtin.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     Examples for the two allowed kinds of attributes are:
     qlogin_command   builtin
     or
     qlogin_command   /usr/bin/telnetd

  rlogin_daemon
     This parameter specifies the mechanism that is to be started
     on  the  server  side of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B> request without a command
     argument to be executed remotely. Usually this is the  buil-
     tin  mechanism.  It's also possible to configure an external
     executable by specifying the absolute pathname, e.g. of  the
     system's rlogin daemon.

     Changing  rlogin_daemon  will  take  immediate  effect.  The
     default for rlogin_daemon is builtin.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     The allowed values are similar to the ones of  the  examples
     of qlogin_daemon.

  rlogin_command
     This is the mechanism to be executed on the client side of a
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B>  request  without  a command argument to be executed
     remotely.  Usually this is  the  builtin  mechanism.  If  no
     value  is  given, a specialized Sun Grid Engine component is
     used.  The command is automatically started with the  target
     host  and  port  number  as parameters.  The Sun Grid Engine
     rlogin client has been extended to accept and use  the  port
     number  argument.  You  can  only  use clients, such as <I>ssh</I>,
     which also understand this syntax.

     Changing rlogin_command  will  take  immediate  effect.  The
     default value for rlogin_command is builtin.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     In addition to the examples of qlogin_command ,  this  value
     is allowed:
     rsh_daemon      none

  rsh_daemon
     This parameter specifies the mechanism that is to be started
     on the server side of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B> request with a command argu-
     ment to be executed remotely.  Usually this is  the  builtin
     mechanism.  If  no  value  is  given, a specialized Sun Grid
     Engine component is used.

     Changing rsh_daemon will take immediate effect. The  default
     value for rsh_daemon is builtin.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     In addition to the examples of qlogin_daemon , this value is
     allowed:
     rsh_daemon      none

  rsh_command
     This is the mechanism to be executed on the client side of a
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B>  request  with  a  command  argument  to be executed
     remotely.  Usually this is the  builtin  mechanism.   If  no
     value  is  given, a specialized Sun Grid Engine component is
     used. The command is automatically started with  the  target
     host  and  port  number as parameters like required for <I>tel-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/net.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">net(1)</A></B> plus the command with its arguments  to  be  executed
     remotely.  The  Sun Grid Engine rsh client has been extended
     to accept and use the port number argument. You can only use
     clients, such as <I>ssh</I>, which also understand this syntax.

     Changing rsh_command will take immediate effect. The default
     value for rsh_command is builtin.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     In addition to the examples of qlogin_command ,  this  value
     is allowed:
     rsh_command     none

  delegated_file_staging
     This flag must be set to "true" when the prolog  and  epilog
     are  ready  for  delegated  file  staging, so that the DRMAA
     attribute 'drmaa_transfer_files' is supported. To  establish
     delegated  file  staging,  use  the variables beginning with
     "$fs_..." in prolog and epilog to move the input, output and
     error  files  from one host to the other.  When this flag is
     set to "false", no file staging is available for  the  DRMAA
     interface.  File  staging  is currently implemented only via
     the DRMAA interface.  When an error occurs while moving  the
     input, output and error files, return error code 100 so that
     the error handling mechanism can handle the error correctly.
     (See also FORBID_APPERROR).

  reprioritize
     Note: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
     This flag enables or disables the reprioritization  of  jobs
     based  on  their ticket amount. The reprioritize_interval in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B> takes effect only if reprioritize  is  set  to
     true.  To  turn  off  job reprioritization, the reprioritize
     flag must be set to false and the reprioritize_interval to 0
     which is the default.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not be overridden by the execution host local configuration.

  jsv_url
     This setting defines a server JSV  instance  which  will  be
     started  and  triggered  by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> process. This
     JSV instance will be used to verify  job  specifications  of
     jobs  before  they  are  accepted and stored in the internal
     master database. The global  configuration  entry  for  this
     value  cannot  be overwritten by execution host local confi-
     gurations.

     Find   more   details   concerning   JSV   in   <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">jsv(1)</A></B>   and
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_request.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_request(1)</A></B>.

     The syntax of the jsv_url is specified in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

  jsv_allowed_mod
     If there is a server JSV script defined with jsv_url parame-
     ter, then all <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qalter(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmon(1)</A></B> modification requests for
     jobs are  rejected  by  qmaster.  With  the  jsv_allowed_mod
     parameter  an  administrator  has the possibility to allow a
     set of switches which can  then  be  used  with  clients  to
     modify  certain job attributes. The value for this parameter
     has to be a comma separated list of JSV job parameter  names
     as they are documented in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> or the value none to indi-
     cate that no modification should  be  allowed.  Please  note
     that  even  if  none is specified the switches -w and -t are
     allowed for qalter.

  libjvm_path
     libjvm_path is usually set during qmaster  installation  and
     points   to   the  absolute  path  of  libjvm.so.   (or  the
     corresponding library depending on your architecture -  e.g.
     /usr/java/jre/lib/i386/server/libjvm.so)    The   referenced
     libjvm version must be at least 1.5.  It is  needed  by  the
     jvm  qmaster  thread  only.  If the java vm needs additional
     starting parameters they can be set in  additional_jvm_args.
     If  the  jvm  thread is started at all can be defined in the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/bootstrap.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">bootstrap(5)</A></B> file. If libjvm_path is empty or  an  incorrect
     path the jvm thread fails to start.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

  additional_jvm_args
     additional_jvm_args is usually set during qmaster  installa-
     tion.  Details about possible values additional_jvm_args can
     be found in the help output of the  accompanying  java  com-
     mand. This setting is normally not needed.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.
