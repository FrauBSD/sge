NAME
     queue_conf - Sun Grid Engine queue configuration file format

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page describes the format of the  template  file
     for  the  cluster  queue configuration.  Via the -aq and -mq
     options of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B> command, you can add cluster  queues
     and  modify  the  configuration of any queue in the cluster.
     Any of these change operations can be rejected, as a  result
     of a failed integrity verification.

     The queue configuration parameters take as  values  strings,
     integer  decimal numbers or boolean, time and memory specif-
     iers   (see   <I>time</I>_<I>specifier</I>   and    <I>memory</I>_<I>specifier</I>    in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(5)</A></B>) as well as comma separated lists.

     Note, Sun Grid Engine allows  backslashes  (\)  be  used  to
     escape  newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the
     newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any
     interpretation.

FORMAT
     The following list of parameters specifies the queue  confi-
     guration file content:

  qname
     The name of the cluster queue as defined for  <I>queue</I>_<I>name</I>  in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  As template default "template" is used.

  hostlist
     A list of host identifiers as defined for <I>host</I>_<I>identifier</I> in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.   For  each  host  Sun Grid Engine maintains a
     queue instance for running jobs  on  that  particular  host.
     Large  amounts  of hosts can easily be managed by using host
     groups rather than by single host names.  As list separators
     white-spaces and "," can be used.  (template default: NONE).

     If more than one host is specified it can  be  desirable  to
     specify  divergences  with  the further below parameter set-
     tings for certain hosts. These divergences can be  expressed
     using  the  enhanced  queue  configuration specifier syntax.
     This syntax builds upon the regular parameter specifier syn-
     tax separately for each parameter:

     "["<I>host</I>_<I>identifier</I>=&lt;parameters_specifier_syntax&gt;"]"
     [,"["<I>host</I>_<I>identifier</I>=&lt;parameters_specifier_syntax&gt;"]" ]

     note, even in the  enhanced  queue  configuration  specifier
     syntax  an  entry without brackets denoting the default set-
     ting is required and used for all queue instances  where  no
     divergences   are  specified.   Tuples  with  a  host  group
     <I>host</I>_<I>identifier</I> override the default setting. Tuples with  a
     host  name host_identifier override both the default and the
     host group setting.

     Note that also with the enhanced queue configuration specif-
     ier  syntax a default setting is always needed for each con-
     figuration attribute; otherwise the queue configuration gets
     rejected.  Ambiguous queue configurations with more than one
     attribute setting for a particular host are rejected.   Con-
     figurations   containing   override  values  for  hosts  not
     enlisted under 'hostname' are accepted but are indicated  by
     -sds of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>.  The cluster queue should contain an unam-
     biguous specification for each  configuration  attribute  of
     each  queue  instance  specified under hostname in the queue
     configuration. Ambiguous configurations with more  than  one
     attribute setting resulting from overlapping host groups are
     indicated by -explain c of  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qstat(1)</A></B>  and  cause  the  queue
     instance   with   ambiguous   configurations  to  enter  the
     c(onfiguration ambiguous) state.

  seq_no
     In conjunction with the hosts load situation at a time  this
     parameter  specifies this queue's position in the scheduling
     order within the suitable queues for a job to be  dispatched
     under    consideration   of   the   queue_sort_method   (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B> ).

     Regardless  of  the  queue_sort_method   setting,   <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qstat(1)</A></B>
     reports  queue information in the order defined by the value
     of  the  seq_no.  Set  this  parameter  to  a  monotonically
     increasing sequence. (type number; template default: 0).

  load_thresholds
     load_thresholds is a list of load thresholds. Already if one
     of  the  thresholds  is  exceeded  no  further  jobs will be
     scheduled to the queues and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmon(1)</A></B> will signal an  overload
     condition for this node. Arbitrary load values being defined
     in the "host" and "global"  complexes  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>  for
     details) can be used.

     The syntax is that of a comma separated list with each  list
     element consisting of the <I>complex</I>_<I>name</I> (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(5)</A></B>) of
     a load value, an equal sign and the  threshold  value  being
     intended   to   trigger   the   overload   situation   (e.g.
     load_avg=1.75,users_logged_in=5).

     Note: Load values as well as  consumable  resources  may  be
     scaled  differently  for different hosts if specified in the
     corresponding   execution   host   definitions   (refer   to
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">host_conf(5)</A></B> for more information). Load thresholds are com-
     pared against the scaled load and consumable values.


  suspend_thresholds
     A list of load thresholds with the same semantics as that of
     the   load_thresholds  parameter  (see  above)  except  that
     exceeding one of the denoted thresholds initiates suspension
     of  one  of  multiple  jobs  in the queue.  See the nsuspend
     parameter below for details on the number of jobs which  are
     suspended.  There  is  an important relationship between the
     uspend_threshold and the cheduler_interval. If you have  for
     example a suspend threshold on the np_load_avg, and the load
     exceeds the threshold, this does not have immediate  effect.
     Jobs  continue  running until the next scheduling run, where
     the scheduler detects the threshold has  been  exceeded  and
     sends  an  order  to  qmaster  to  suspend the job. The same
     applies for unsuspending.

  nsuspend
     The number of jobs  which  are  suspended/enabled  per  time
     interval  if  at  least  one  of  the load thresholds in the
     suspend_thresholds   list   is    exceeded    or    if    no
     suspend_threshold    is   violated   anymore   respectively.
     Nsuspend jobs are suspended in each time interval  until  no
     suspend_thresholds  are  exceeded anymore or all jobs in the
     queue are suspended. Jobs are enabled in  the  corresponding
     way  if  the suspend_thresholds are no longer exceeded.  The
     time interval in which the suspensions of the jobs occur  is
     defined in suspend_interval below.

  suspend_interval
     The  time  interval  in  which  further  nsuspend  jobs  are
     suspended  if  one  of the suspend_thresholds (see above for
     both) is exceeded by the current load on the host  on  which
     the  queue  is located.  The time interval is also used when
     enabling the jobs. The syntax is that of a <I>time</I>_<I>specifier</I> in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(5)</A></B>.

  priority
     The priority parameter specifies the <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/nice.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">nice(2)</A></B> value at  which
     jobs  in  this queue will be run. The type is number and the
     default is zero (which means no nice  value  is  set  expli-
     citly).  Negative  values (up to -20) correspond to a higher
     scheduling priority, positive values (up to +20)  correspond
     to a lower scheduling priority.

     Note, the value of priority  has  no  effect,  if  Sun  Grid
     Engine  adjusts  priorities dynamically to implement ticket-
     based entitlement policy goals. Dynamic priority  adjustment
     is  switched  off by default due to <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B> reprioritize
     being set to false.

  min_cpu_interval
     The time between two automatic checkpoints in case of  tran-
     sparently  checkpointing  jobs.  The  maximum  of  the  time
     requested by the user via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> and the  time  defined  by
     the  queue  configuration  is  used  as checkpoint interval.
     Since checkpoint files may be considerably  large  and  thus
     writing  them to the file system may become expensive, users
     and administrators are advised to choose sufficiently  large
     time  intervals.  min_cpu_interval  is  of type time and the
     default is 5 minutes (which usually  is  suitable  for  test
     purposes  only).   The syntax is that of a <I>time</I>_<I>specifier</I> in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(5)</A></B>.

  processors
     A set of processors in case of  a  multiprocessor  execution
     host  can  be  defined  to  which the jobs executing in this
     queue are bound. The value type of this parameter is a range
     description  like that of the -pe option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> (e.g. 1-
     4,8,10) denoting the processor  numbers  for  the  processor
     group  to  be  used.  Obviously  the interpretation of these
     values relies on operating system specifics and is thus per-
     formed inside <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> running on the queue host. There-
     fore, the parsing of the parameter has to be provided by the
     execution  daemon  and  the parameter is only passed through
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> as a string.

     Currently,  support  is  only  provided  for  multiprocessor
     machines  running  Solaris, SGI multiprocessor machines run-
     ning IRIX 6.2 and Digital UNIX multiprocessor  machines.  In
     the  case  of  Solaris the processor set must already exist,
     when this processors parameter is configured. So the proces-
     sor  set has to be created manually.  In the case of Digital
     UNIX only one job per processor set is allowed to execute at
     the  same  time,  i.e.  slots (see above) should be set to 1
     for this queue.

  qtype
     The type of queue. Currently <I>batch</I>, <I>interactive</I> or a  combi-
     nation in a comma separated list or <I>NONE</I>.

     The formerly supported types parallel and checkpointing  are
     not  allowed anymore. A queue instance is implicitly of type
     parallel/checkpointing if there is a parallel environment or
     a  checkpointing interface specified for this queue instance
     in pe_list/ckpt_list. Formerly possible settings e.g.

     qtype   PARALLEL

     could be transferred into

     qtype   NONE
     pe_list pe_name

     (type string; default: batch interactive).

  pe_list
     The list of administrator-defined parallel environment  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_pe(5)</A></B>)  names  to  be  associated  with  the  queue. The
     default is <I>NONE</I>.

  ckpt_list
     The list of  administrator-defined  checkpointing  interface
     names  (see <I>ckpt</I>_<I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>) to be associated with
     the queue. The default is <I>NONE</I>.

  rerun
     Defines a default behavior for jobs  which  are  aborted  by
     system crashes or manual "violent" (via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">kill(1)</A></B>) shutdown of
     the  complete  Sun  Grid  Engine   system   (including   the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B>  of the jobs and their process hierarchy) on
     the queue host. As soon as  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  is  restarted  and
     detects  that a job has been aborted for such reasons it can
     be restarted if the jobs are restartable. A job may  not  be
     restartable,  for  example,  if  it updates databases (first
     reads then writes to the same  record  of  a  database/file)
     because  the  abortion of the job may have left the database
     in an inconsistent state. If the owner of  a  job  wants  to
     overrule  the default behavior for the jobs in the queue the
     -r option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> can be used.

     The type of this parameter is boolean, thus either  TRUE  or
     FALSE  can  be  specified. The default is FALSE, i.e. do not
     restart jobs automatically.

  slots
     The maximum number of concurrently executing jobs allowed in
     the queue.  Type is number, valid values are 0 to 9999999.

  tmpdir
     The tmpdir parameter specifies the absolute path to the base
     of  the  temporary  directory  filesystem. When <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
     launches a job, it creates  a  uniquely-named  directory  in
     this  filesystem  for  the  purpose of holding scratch files
     during job execution. At job completion, this directory  and
     its  contents  are  removed  automatically.  The environment
     variables TMPDIR and TMP are set to the path  of  each  jobs
     scratch directory (type string; default: /tmp).

  shell
     If either <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I> or <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I> is  specified
     as  the  shell_start_mode parameter in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B> the shell
     parameter specifies  the  executable  path  of  the  command
     interpreter  (e.g.   <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sh(1)</A></B>  or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">csh(1)</A></B>) to be used to process
     the job scripts executed in the  queue.  The  definition  of
     shell  can  be overruled by the job owner via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> -S
     option.

     The  type  of  the  parameter  is  string.  The  default  is
     /bin/csh.

  shell_start_mode
     This parameter defines the  mechanisms  which  are  used  to
     actually  invoke the job scripts on the execution hosts. The
     following values are recognized:

     <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I>
          If a user starts a job shell script under UNIX interac-
          tively  by  invoking  it  just with the script name the
          operating system's executable loader uses the  informa-
          tion  provided in a comment such as `#!/bin/csh' in the
          first line of the script to detect which command inter-
          preter to start to interpret the script. This mechanism
          is used by  Sun  Grid  Engine  when  starting  jobs  if
          <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I> is defined as shell_start_mode.

     <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>
          POSIX does not consider first script line comments such
          a `#!/bin/csh' as being significant. The POSIX standard
          for batch queuing systems (P1003.2d) therefore requires
          a  compliant queuing system to ignore such lines but to
          use user specified or configured default command inter-
          preters  instead.  Thus,  if shell_start_mode is set to
          <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I> Sun Grid Engine  will  either  use  the
          command  interpreter  indicated by the -S option of the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> command or the shell parameter of the queue  to
          be used (see above).

     <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I>
          Setting  the  shell_start_mode  parameter   either   to
          <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>  or  <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I>  requires you to set
          the umask in use for <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> such that every  user
          has  read  access  to  the active_jobs directory in the
          spool directory of the corresponding execution  daemon.
          In  case you have prolog and epilog scripts configured,
          they also need to be readable by any user who may  exe-
          cute jobs.
          If this violates your site's security policies you  may
          want to set shell_start_mode to <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I>. This
          will force Sun Grid Engine to open the  job  script  as
          well  as  the epilogue and prologue scripts for reading
          into STDIN as root  (if  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  was  started  as
          root)  before changing to the job owner's user account.
          The script is then fed into the  STDIN  stream  of  the
          command  interpreter  indicated by the -S option of the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> command or the shell parameter of the queue  to
          be used (see above).
          Thus setting shell_start_mode to <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I> also
          implies  <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>  behavior. Note, however, that
          feeding scripts into the  STDIN  stream  of  a  command
          interpreter  may  cause trouble if commands like <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">rsh(1)</A></B>
          are invoked inside a job script as  they  also  process
          the  STDIN  stream  of  the  command interpreter. These
          problems can usually be  resolved  by  redirecting  the
          STDIN  channel of those commands to come from /dev/null
          (e.g. rsh host date &lt; /dev/null). Note also,  that  any
          command-line options associated with the job are passed
          to the executing shell. The  shell  will  only  forward
          them  to  the  job  if they are not recognized as valid
          shell options.

     The default for shell_start_mode is <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>.   Note,
     though, that the shell_start_mode can only be used for batch
     jobs submitted by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> and can't be used for  interactive
     jobs submitted by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qlogin.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qlogin(1)</A></B>.

  prolog
     The executable path of a shell script that is started before
     execution  of Sun Grid Engine jobs with the same environment
     setting as that for the Sun Grid Engine jobs to  be  started
     afterwards.  An  optional  prefix "user@" specifies the user
     under which this procedure is to be started. The  procedures
     standard  output  and the error output stream are written to
     the same file used also for the standard  output  and  error
     output  of  each job.  This procedure is intended as a means
     for the Sun Grid Engine administrator to automate the execu-
     tion  of general site specific tasks like the preparation of
     temporary file systems with the need for  the  same  context
     information  as  the  job.  This  queue  configuration entry
     overwrites cluster global or execution host specific  prolog
     definitions (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

     The default for prolog is  the  special  value  NONE,  which
     prevents  from execution of a prologue script.  The  special
     variables for constituting a command line are the same  like
     in  prolog  definitions  of  the  cluster configuration (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

     Exit codes for the prolog attribute can be interpreted based
     on the following exit values:
          0: Success
          99: Reschedule job
          100: Put job in error state
          Anything else: Put queue in error state

  epilog
     The executable path of a shell script that is started  after
     execution  of Sun Grid Engine jobs with the same environment
     setting as that for the Sun Grid Engine jobs that  has  just
     completed.  An  optional  prefix  "user@" specifies the user
     under which this procedure is to be started. The  procedures
     standard  output  and the error output stream are written to
     the same file used also for the standard  output  and  error
     output  of  each  job. This procedure is intended as a means
     for the Sun Grid Engine administrator to automate the execu-
     tion  of general site specific tasks like the cleaning up of
     temporary file systems with the need for  the  same  context
     information  as  the  job.  This  queue  configuration entry
     overwrites cluster global or execution host specific  epilog
     definitions (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

     The default for epilog is  the  special  value  NONE,  which
     prevents  from execution of a epilogue script.  The  special
     variables for constituting a command line are the same  like
     in  prolog  definitions  of  the  cluster configuration (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

     Exit codes for the epilog attribute can be interpreted based
     on the following exit values:
          0: Success
          99: Reschedule job
          100: Put job in error state
          Anything else: Put queue in error state

  starter_method
     The specified executable path will be used as a job  starter
     facility  responsible  for starting batch jobs.  The execut-
     able path will be executed instead of the  configured  shell
     to  start the job. The job arguments will be passed as argu-
     ments to the job starter. The  following  environment  vari-
     ables  are  used to pass information to the job starter con-
     cerning  the  shell  environment  which  was  configured  or
     requested to start the job.


     <I>SGE</I>_<I>STARTER</I>_<I>SHELL</I>_<I>PATH</I>
          The name of the requested shell to start the job

     <I>SGE</I>_<I>STARTER</I>_<I>SHELL</I>_<I>START</I>_<I>MODE</I>
          The configured shell_start_mode

     <I>SGE</I>_<I>STARTER</I>_<I>USE</I>_<I>LOGIN</I>_<I>SHELL</I>
          Set to "true" if the shell is supposed to be used as  a
          login shell (see login_shells in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>)

     The starter_method will not be invoked for  qsh,  qlogin  or
     qrsh acting as rlogin.


  suspend_method
  resume_method
  terminate_method
     These parameters can be used  for  overwriting  the  default
     method  used by Sun Grid Engine for suspension, release of a
     suspension and for termination of a job.  Per  default,  the
     signals  SIGSTOP,  SIGCONT  and SIGKILL are delivered to the
     job to perform these actions. However, for some applications
     this is not appropriate.

     If no executable path is given, Sun Grid  Engine  takes  the
     specified  parameter  entries  as the signal to be delivered
     instead of the default signal. A signal  must  be  either  a
     positive  number  or  a signal name with "SIG" as prefix and
     the signal name as printed by <I>kill</I> -<I>l</I> (e.g.  SIGTERM).

     If an executable path is given (it must be an <I>absolute</I>  <I>path</I>
     starting  with  a  "/")  then this command together with its
     arguments is started by  Sun  Grid  Engine  to  perform  the
     appropriate  action.  The  following  special  variables are
     expanded at runtime and  can  be  used  (besides  any  other
     strings  which  have to be interpreted by the procedures) to
     constitute a command line:


     $<I>host</I>
          The name of the host on which the procedure is started.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>owner</I>
          The user name of the job owner.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>
          Sun Grid Engine's unique job identification number.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>name</I>
          The name of the job.

     $<I>queue</I>
          The name of the queue.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>pid</I>
          The pid of the job.


  notify
     The time waited between delivery of SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2  notifi-
     cation signals and suspend/kill signals if job was submitted
     with the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> -<I>notify</I> option.

  owner_list
     The owner_list enlists comma  separated  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/login.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">login(1)</A></B>  user
     names (see <I>user</I>_<I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>) of those users who are
     authorized to disable and suspend this queue through <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmod(1)</A></B>
     (Sun  Grid  Engine  operators  and  managers  can do this by
     default). It is customary to set this field  for  queues  on
     interactive  workstations  where the computing resources are
     shared between interactive  sessions  and  Sun  Grid  Engine
     jobs,  allowing  the  workstation  owner  to  have  priority
     access.  (default: NONE).

  user_lists
     The user_lists parameter contains a comma separated list  of
     Sun  Grid  Engine  user  access  list  names as described in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user contained in at least one of  the
     enlisted  access  lists  has  access  to  the  queue. If the
     user_lists parameter is set to NONE (the default)  any  user
     has access being not explicitly excluded via the xuser_lists
     parameter described below.  If a user is contained  both  in
     an  access  list  enlisted in xuser_lists and user_lists the
     user is denied access to the queue.

  xuser_lists
     The xuser_lists parameter contains a comma separated list of
     Sun  Grid  Engine  user  access  list  names as described in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user contained in at least one of  the
     enlisted access lists is not allowed to access the queue. If
     the xuser_lists parameter is set to NONE (the  default)  any
     user  has  access.  If a user is contained both in an access
     list enlisted in xuser_lists  and  user_lists  the  user  is
     denied access to the queue.

  projects
     The projects parameter contains a comma  separated  list  of
     Sun  Grid  Engine projects (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">project(5)</A></B>) that have access
     to the queue. Any project not in this list are denied access
     to  the queue. If set to NONE (the default), any project has
     access that is not specifically excluded via  the  xprojects
     parameter  described below. If a project is in both the pro-
     jects and xprojects parameters, the project is denied access
     to the queue.

  xprojects
     The xprojects parameter contains a comma separated  list  of
     Sun  Grid  Engine  projects (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">project(5)</A></B>) that are denied
     access to the queue. If set to NONE (the default),  no  pro-
     jects are denied access other than those denied access based
     on the projects parameter described above.  If a project  is
     in  both  the projects and xprojects parameters, the project
     is denied access to the queue.

  subordinate_list
     There are two different types of subordination:

     1. Queuewise subordination

     A list of  Sun  Grid  Engine  queue  names  as  defined  for
     <I>queue</I>_<I>name</I>  in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  Subordinate relationships are
     in effect only between queue instances residing at the  same
     host.  The  relationship  does not apply and is ignored when
     jobs are running in queue instances on  other  hosts.  Queue
     instances residing on the same host will be suspended when a
     specified count of jobs is running in this  queue  instance.
     The   list   specification  is  the  same  as  that  of  the
     load_thresholds parameter above,  e.g.  low_pri_q=5,small_q.
     The  numbers  denote the job slots of the queue that have to
     be filled in the superordinated queue to trigger the suspen-
     sion  of  the  subordinated queue. If no value is assigned a
     suspension is triggered  if  all  slots  of  the  queue  are
     filled.

     On nodes which host more than one queue, you might  wish  to
     accord  better  service  to  certain  classes of jobs (e.g.,
     queues that are dedicated to parallel processing might  need
     priority  over  low  priority  production  queues;  default:
     NONE).

     2. Slotwise preemption

     The slotwise preemption provides a means to ensure that high
     priority jobs get the resources they need, while at the same
     time low priority jobs on the same  host  are  not  unneces-
     sarily  preempted,  maximizing  the  host  utilization.  The
     slotwise preemption is designed to provide different preemp-
     tion  actions,  but  with  the  current  implementation only
     suspension is provided.  This means there is a subordination
     relationship defined between queues similar to the queuewise
     subordination, but if the suspend threshold is exceeded, not
     the  whole  subordinated  queue is suspended, there are only
     single tasks running in single slots suspended.

     Like with queuewise subordination, the  subordination  rela-
     tionships  are in effect only between queue instances resid-
     ing at the same host. The relationship does not apply and is
     ignored  when  jobs and tasks are running in queue instances
     on other hosts.

     The syntax is:

     slots=&lt;threshold&gt;(&lt;queue_list&gt;)

     where
     &lt;threshold&gt; =a positive integer number
     &lt;queue_list&gt;=&lt;queue_def&gt;[,&lt;queue_list&gt;]
     &lt;queue_def&gt; =&lt;queue&gt;[:&lt;seq_no&gt;][:&lt;action&gt;]
     &lt;queue&gt;     =a Sun Grid Engine queue name as defined for
                  <I>queue</I>_<I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.
     &lt;seq_no&gt;    =sequence number among all subordinated queues
                  of the same depth in the tree. The higher the
                  sequence number, the lower is the priority of
                  the queue.
                  Default is 0, which is the highest priority.

     &lt;action&gt;    =the action to be taken if the threshold is
                  exceeded. Supported is:
                  "sr": Suspend the task with the shortest run
                        time.
                  "lr": Suspend the task with the longest run
                        time.
                  Default is "sr".

     Some examples of possible  configurations  and  their  func-
     tionalities:

     a) The simplest configuration

     subordinate_list   slots=2(B.q)

     which means the queue "B.q" is subordinated to  the  current
     queue  (let's  call it "A.q"), the suspend threshold for all
     tasks running in "A.q" and "B.q" on the current host is two,
     the  sequence  number  of  "B.q"  is  "0"  and the action is
     "suspend task with shortest run time first". This subordina-
     tion relationship looks like this:

           A.q
            |
           B.q

     This could be a typical configuration for a host with a dual
     core  CPU.  This  subordination  configuration  ensures that
     tasks that are scheduled to "A.q" always get a CPU core  for
     themselves, while jobs in "B.q" are not preempted as long as
     there are no jobs running in "A.q".

     If there is no task running in "A.q", two tasks are  running
     in  "B.q"  and  a new task is scheduled to "A.q", the sum of
     tasks running in "A.q" and "B.q" is three. Three is  greater
     than  two, this triggers the defined action. This causes the
     task with the shortest run time in  the  subordinated  queue
     "B.q"  to  be suspended. After suspension, there is one task
     running in "A.q", on task running  in  "B.q"  and  one  task
     suspended in "B.q".

     b) A simple tree

     subordinate_list   slots=2(B.q:1, C.q:2)

     This defines a small tree that looks like this:

           A.q
          /   \
        B.q   C.q


     A use case for this configuration could be  a  host  with  a
     dual  core  CPU and queue "B.q" and "C.q" for jobs with dif-
     ferent requirements, e.g. "B.q" for interactive jobs,  "C.q"
     for  batch jobs.  Again, the tasks in "A.q" always get a CPU
     core, while tasks in "B.q" and "C.q" are suspended  only  if
     the  threshold  of  running  tasks  is  exceeded.   Here the
     sequence number among the queues of  the  same  depth  comes
     into  play.  Tasks scheduled to "B.q" can't directly trigger
     the suspension of tasks in "C.q", but if there is a task  to
     be  suspended,  first  "C.q" will be searched for a suitable
     task.

     If there is one task running in "A.q", one in  "C.q"  and  a
     new  task  is  scheduled  to  "B.q", the threshold of "2" in
     "A.q", "B.q"  and  "C.q"  is  exceeded.  This  triggers  the
     suspension  of  one  task  in  either  "B.q"  or  "C.q". The
     sequence number gives "B.q" a higher  priority  than  "C.q",
     therefore  the task in "C.q" is suspended. After suspension,
     there is one task running in  "A.q",  one  task  running  in
     "B.q" and one task suspended in "C.q".

     c) More than two levels

     Configuration of A.q: subordinate_list   slots=2(B.q)
     Configuration of B.q: subordinate_list   slots=2(C.q)

     looks like this:

           A.q
            |
           B.q
            |
           C.q

     These are three queues with high, medium and  low  priority.
     If  a task is scheduled to "C.q", first the subtree consist-
     ing of "B.q" and "C.q" is checked, the number of tasks  run-
     ning  there is counted. If the threshold which is defined in
     "B.q" is exceeded, the job in "C.q" is suspended.  Then  the
     whole  tree  is  checked,  if the number of tasks running in
     "A.q", "B.q" and "C.q"  exceeds  the  threshold  defined  in
     "A.q" the task in "C.q" is suspended. This means, the effec-
     tive threshold of any subtree is not higher than the  thres-
     hold  of  the  root  node of the tree.  If in this example a
     task is scheduled to "A.q", immediately the number of  tasks
     running  in  "A.q",  "B.q"  and "C.q" is checked against the
     threshold defined in "A.q".

     d) Any tree

            A.q
           /   \

         B.q   C.q
        /     /   \
      D.q    E.q  F.q
                     \
                      G.q

     The computation of the tasks that are  to  be  (un)suspended
     always starts at the queue instance that is modified, i.e. a
     task is scheduled to, a task ends at, the  configuration  is
     modified, a manual or other automatic (un)suspend is issued,
     except when it is a leaf node, like "D.q", "E.q"  and  "G.q"
     in  this  example. Then the computation starts at its parent
     queue instance (like "B.q", "C.q" or "F.q" in this example).
     From  there  first all running tasks in the whole subtree of
     this queue instance are counted.  If  the  sum  exceeds  the
     threshold  configured  in the subordinate_list, in this sub-
     tree a task is searched to be suspended. Then the  algorithm
     proceeds  to  the  parent of this queue instance, counts all
     running tasks in the whole  subtree  below  the  parent  and
     checks if the number exceeds the threshold configured at the
     parent's subordinate_list. If so, it searches for a task  to
     suspend  in  the  whole subtree below the parent. And so on,
     until it did this computation for the root node of the tree.


  complex_values
     complex_values  defines  quotas  for   resource   attributes
     managed  via  this  queue.  The  syntax  is  the same as for
     load_thresholds (see above). The quotas are related  to  the
     resource  consumption  of all jobs in a queue in the case of
     consumable resources (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B> for details on  consum-
     able  resources) or they are interpreted on a per queue slot
     (see slots  above)  basis  in  the  case  of  non-consumable
     resources.  Consumable resource attributes are commonly used
     to manage free memory, free disk space or available floating
     software  licenses  while  non-consumable attributes usually
     define distinctive characteristics  like  type  of  hardware
     installed.

     For consumable resource  attributes  an  available  resource
     amount  is  determined  by  subtracting the current resource
     consumption of all running jobs in the queue from the  quota
     in the complex_values list. Jobs can only be dispatched to a
     queue if  no  resource  requests  exceed  any  corresponding
     resource  availability  obtained  by  this scheme. The quota
     definition  in  the  complex_values  list  is  automatically
     replaced  by the current load value reported for this attri-
     bute, if load is monitored for  this  resource  and  if  the
     reported  load  value is more stringent than the quota. This
     effectively avoids oversubscription of resources.


     Note: Load values replacing  the  quota  specifications  may
     have  become  more  stringent  because they have been scaled
     (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">host_conf(5)</A></B>) and/or load adjusted (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B>).
     The  -<I>F</I>  option  of  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qstat(1)</A></B>  and  the  load display in the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmon(1)</A></B> queue control dialog (activated  by  clicking  on  a
     queue  icon  while  the  "Shift"  key  is  pressed)  provide
     detailed information on the actual availability  of  consum-
     able  resources  and  on the origin of the values taken into
     account currently.

     Note also: The resource consumption of  running  jobs  (used
     for  the  availability  calculation) as well as the resource
     requests of the jobs waiting to be dispatched either may  be
     derived  from  explicit  user requests during job submission
     (see the -<I>l</I> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>) or  from  a  "default"  value
     configured  for  an attribute by the administrator (see <I>com-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/plex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">plex(5)</A></B>).  The  -<I>r</I>  option  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qstat(1)</A></B>  can  be  used  for
     retrieving  full  detail  on the actual resource requests of
     all jobs in the system.

     For non-consumable resources Sun Grid Engine simply compares
     the job's attribute requests with the corresponding specifi-
     cation in complex_values taking the relation operator of the
     complex  attribute definition into account (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>).
     If the result of the comparison  is  "true",  the  queue  is
     suitable  for  the job with respect to the particular attri-
     bute. For parallel jobs each queue slot to be occupied by  a
     parallel  task  is meant to provide the same resource attri-
     bute value.

     Note: Only numeric complex attributes can be defined as con-
     sumable  resources  and  hence  non-numeric  attributes  are
     always handled on a per queue slot basis.

     The default value  for  this  parameter  is  NONE,  i.e.  no
     administrator  defined resource attribute quotas are associ-
     ated with the queue.

  calendar
     specifies the calendar to be valid for this  queue  or  con-
     tains  NONE (the default). A calendar defines the availabil-
     ity of a queue depending on time  of  day,  week  and  year.
     Please refer to <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">calendar_conf(5)</A></B> for details on the Sun Grid
     Engine calendar facility.

     Note: Jobs can request queues with a certain calendar  model
     via a "-<I>l</I> <I>c</I>=&lt;<I>cal</I>_<I>name</I>&gt;" option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>.

  initial_state
     defines an initial state for the queue  either  when  adding
     the queue to the system for the first time or on start-up of
     the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the host on  which  the  queue  resides.
     Possible values are:

     default   The queue is enabled when adding the queue  or  is
               reset  to  the  previous  status when <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
               comes up (this corresponds to the behavior in ear-
               lier  Sun  Grid  Engine  releases  not  supporting
               initial_state).

     enabled   The queue is  enabled  in  either  case.  This  is
               equivalent to a manual and explicit '<I>qmod</I> -<I>e</I>' com-
               mand (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmod(1)</A></B>).

     disabled  The queue is  disable  in  either  case.  This  is
               equivalent to a manual and explicit '<I>qmod</I> -<I>d</I>' com-
               mand (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmod(1)</A></B>).

RESOURCE LIMITS
     The first two resource limit parameters, s_rt and h_rt,  are
     implemented  by Sun Grid Engine. They define the "real time"
     or also called "elapsed" or "wall clock" time having  passed
     since  the  start  of  the job. If h_rt is exceeded by a job
     running in the queue, it is aborted via the  SIGKILL  signal
     (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">kill(1)</A></B>).   If  s_rt  is  exceeded,  the  job is first
     "warned" via the SIGUSR1 signal (which can be caught by  the
     job) and finally aborted after the notification time defined
     in the queue configuration parameter notify (see above)  has
     passed.  In  cases when s_rt is used in combination with job
     notification it might be necessary  to  configure  a  signal
     other  than  SIGUSR1  using  the NOTIFY_KILL and NOTIFY_SUSP
     execd_params (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>) so  that  the  jobs'  signal-
     catching  mechanism can "differ" the cases and react accord-
     ingly.

     The resource limit parameters s_cpu  and  h_cpu  are  imple-
     mented  by  Sun  Grid  Engine  as a job limit. They impose a
     limit on the amount of combined CPU time consumed by all the
     processes  in the job. If h_cpu is exceeded by a job running
     in the queue, it  is  aborted  via  a  SIGKILL  signal  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">kill(1)</A></B>).   If  s_cpu is exceeded, the job is sent a SIGXCPU
     signal which can be caught by the job. If you wish to  allow
     a  job to be "warned" so it can exit gracefully before it is
     killed then you should set the s_cpu limit to a lower  value
     than  h_cpu.   For  parallel processes, the limit is applied
     per slot which means that the limit  is  multiplied  by  the
     number of slots being used by the job before being applied.

     The resource limit parameters s_vmem and h_vmem  are  imple-
     mented  by  Sun  Grid  Engine  as a job limit. They impose a
     limit on the amount of combined virtual memory  consumed  by
     all the processes in the job. If h_vmem is exceeded by a job
     running in the queue, it is aborted  via  a  SIGKILL  signal
     (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">kill(1)</A></B>).   If  s_vmem  is exceeded, the job is sent a
     SIGXCPU signal which can be caught by the job.  If you  wish
     to  allow  a  job  to  be "warned" so it can exit gracefully
     before it is killed then you should set the s_vmem limit  to
     a  lower  value  than  h_vmem.   For parallel processes, the
     limit is applied per slot which means that the limit is mul-
     tiplied  by the number of slots being used by the job before
     being applied.

     The remaining parameters in the queue configuration template
     specify per job soft and hard resource limits as implemented
     by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">setrlimit(2)</A></B> system call. See  this  manual  page  on
     your  system  for  more information.  By default, each limit
     field is set  to  infinity  (which  means  RLIM_INFINITY  as
     described  in  the <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">setrlimit(2)</A></B> manual page). The value type
     for the CPU-time limits s_cpu and h_cpu is time.  The  value
     type  for the other limits is memory.  Note: Not all systems
     support <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">setrlimit(2)</A></B>.

     Note also: s_vmem  and  h_vmem  (virtual  memory)  are  only
     available    on    systems   supporting   RLIMIT_VMEM   (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">setrlimit(2)</A></B> on your operating system).

     The UNICOS operating system supplied by  SGI/Cray  does  not
     support  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">setrlimit(2)</A></B>  system  call,  using  their  own
     resource limit-setting system call instead.  For UNICOS sys-
     tems only, the following meanings apply:

     s_cpu     The per-process CPU time limit in seconds.

     s_core    The per-process maximum core file size in bytes.

     s_data    The per-process maximum memory limit in bytes.

     s_vmem    The same as s_data (if both are set the minimum is
               used).

     h_cpu     The per-job CPU time limit in seconds.

     h_data    The per-job maximum memory limit in bytes.

     h_vmem    The same as h_data (if both are set the minimum is
               used).

     h_fsize   The total number of disk blocks that this job  can
               create.
