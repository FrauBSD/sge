NAME
     reporting - Sun Grid Engine reporting file format

DESCRIPTION
     A  Sun  Grid  Engine  system  writes  a  reporting  file  to
     $SGE_ROOT/default/common/reporting.  The reporting file con-
     tains data that can be used for accounting,  monitoring  and
     analysis  purposes.  It contains information about the clus-
     ter (hosts, queues, load values, consumables,  etc.),  about
     the  jobs  running in the cluster and about sharetree confi-
     guration and usage.  All information is time related, events
     are dumped to the reporting file in a configurable interval.
     It allows to monitor a "real time" status of the cluster  as
     well as historical analysis.

FORMAT
     The reporting file is an ASCII file.  Each line contains one
     record, and the fields of a record are separated by a delim-
     iter (:).  The reporting file contains records of  different
     type. Each record type has a specific record structure.

     The first two fields are common to all reporting records:

     time Time (GMT unix timestamp) when the record was created.

     record type
          Type of the accounting record.  The different types  of
          records  and  their structure are described in the fol-
          lowing text.

  new_job
     The new_job record is written whenever a new job enters  the
     system (usually by a submitting command). It has the follow-
     ing fields:

     submission_time
          Time (GMT unix time stamp) when the job was submitted.

     job_number
          The job number.

     task_number
          The array task id. Always has the value -1 for  new_job
          records (as we don't have array tasks yet).

     pe_taskid
          The task id of parallel tasks.  Always  has  the  value
          "none" for new_job records.

     job_name
          The job name (from -N submission option)

     owner
          The job owner.

     group
          The unix group of the job owner.

     project
          The project the job is running in.

     department
          The department the job owner is in.

     account
          The account string specified for the job (from -A  sub-
          mission option).

     priority
          The job priority (from -p submission option).

  job_log
     The job_log record is written whenever a job, an array  task
     or a pe tasks is changing status. A status change can be the
     transition from pending to running, but can  also  be  trig-
     gered  by user actions like suspension of a job.  It has the
     following fields:

     event_time
          Time (GMT unix time stamp)  when  the  event  was  gen-
          erated.

     event
          A one word description of the event.

     job_number
          The job number.

     task_number
          The array task id. Always has the value -1 for  new_job
          records (as we don't have array tasks yet).

     pe_taskid
          The task id of parallel tasks.  Always  has  the  value
          "none" for new_job records.

     state
          The state of the job after the event was processed.

     user The user who initiated the event (or special  usernames
          "qmaster",  "scheduler"  and "execd" for actions of the
          system itself  like  scheduling  jobs,  executing  jobs
          etc.).

     host The host from which the action was initiated (e.g.  the
          submit host, the qmaster host, etc.).

     state_time
          Reserved field for later use.

     submission_time
          Time (GMT unix time stamp) when the job was submitted.

     job_name
          The job name (from -N submission option)

     owner
          The job owner.

     group
          The unix group of the job owner.

     project
          The project the job is running in.

     department
          The department the job owner is in.

     account
          The account string specified for the job (from -A  sub-
          mission option).

     priority
          The job priority (from -p submission option).

     message
          A message describing the reported action.

  acct
     Records of type acct are accounting records. Normally,  they
     are  written  whenever a job, a task of an array job, or the
     task of a parallel job terminates. However, for long running
     jobs an intermediate acct record is created once a day after
     a midnight. This results in multiple accounting records  for
     a  particular  job  and  allows  for a fine-grained resource
     usage monitoring over time. Accounting records comprise  the
     following fields:

     qname
          Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.

     hostname
          Name of the execution host.

     group
          The effective group id of the job owner when  executing
          the job.

     owner
          Owner of the Sun Grid Engine job.

     job_name
          Job name.

     job_number
          Job identifier - job number.

     account
          An account  string  as  specified  by  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>  or
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qalter(1)</A></B> -A option.

     priority
          Priority value assigned to the job corresponding to the
          priority  parameter  in  the  queue  configuration (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).

     submission_time
          Submission time (GMT unix time stamp).

     start_time
          Start time (GMT unix time stamp).

     end_time
          End time (GMT unix time stamp).

     failed
          Indicates the problem which  occurred  in  case  a  job
          could  not  be  started  on  the  execution  host (e.g.
          because the owner of the  job  did  not  have  a  valid
          account  on  that machine). If Sun Grid Engine tries to
          start a job multiple times, this may lead  to  multiple
          entries  in  the  accounting  file corresponding to the
          same job ID.

     exit_status
          Exit status of the  job  script  (or  Sun  Grid  Engine
          specific status in case of certain error conditions).

     ru_wallclock
          Difference between end_time and start_time (see above).

     The remainder of the accounting entries follows the contents
     of  the  standard  UNIX  rusage  structure  as  described in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/getrusage.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">getrusage(2)</A></B>.  Depending on the operating system  where  the
     job was executed some of the fields may be 0.  The following

     parameter <I>sharelog</I>  sets  an  interval  in  which  sharetree
     information  will  be  dumped.   It  is  set  in  the format
     HH:MM:SS. A value of 00:00:00 configures qmaster not to dump
     sharetree  information.  Intervals  of several minutes up to
     hours are sensible values for this  parameter.   The  record
     contains the following fields
