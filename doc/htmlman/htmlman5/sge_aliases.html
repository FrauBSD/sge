NAME
     sge_aliases - Sun Grid Engine path aliases file format

DESCRIPTION
     The Sun Grid Engine path aliasing facility provides adminis-
     trators  and users with the means to reflect complicated and
     in-homogeneous  file  system   structures   in   distributed
     environments  (such  as  user home directories mounted under
     different paths on different hosts) and to ensure  that  Sun
     Grid Engine is able to locate the appropriate working direc-
     tories for executing batch jobs.

     There is a system global path aliasing file and a user local
     file.  <I>sge</I>_<I>aliases</I> defines the format of both:

     <B>o</B>  Blank lines and lines with a '#' sign in the first column
        are skipped.

     <B>o</B>  Each line other than a blank line or a line lead  by  '#'
        has  to  contain  four strings separated by any number of
        blanks or tabs.

     <B>o</B>  The first string specifies a source-path,  the  second  a
        submit-host,  the  third an execution-host and the fourth
        the source-path replacement.

     <B>o</B>  Both the submit- and the execution-host entries may  con-
        sist of only a '*' sign which matches any host.

     If the -<I>cwd</I> flag (and only if - otherwise  the  user's  home
     directory  on  the execution host is selected to execute the
     job) to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> was specified, the path  aliasing  mechanism
     is activated and the files are processed as follows:

     <B>o</B>  After <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> has retrieved the physical current  working
        directory  path, the cluster global path aliasing file is
        read if present. The  user  path  aliases  file  is  read
        afterwards as if it were appended to the global file.

     <B>o</B>  Lines not to be skipped are read from the top of the file
        one  by  one  while  the  translations specified by those
        lines are stored if necessary.

     <B>o</B>  A translation is stored only  if  the  submit-host  entry
        matches  the  host  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>  is  executed  on  and if the
        source-path forms the initial part either of the  current
        working  directory  or  of  the  source-path replacements
        already stored.

     <B>o</B>  As soon as both files are read the stored  path  aliasing
        information is passed along with the submitted job.

     <B>o</B>  On the execution host, the aliasing information  will  be
        evaluated. The leading part of the current working direc-
        tory will be replaced by the source-path  replacement  if
        the  execution-host  entry  of the path alias matches the
        executing  host.  Note:  The  current  working  directory
        string  will  be changed in this case and subsequent path
        aliases must match the replaced working directory path to
        be applied.

EXAMPLES
     The following is a simple example of a  path  aliasing  file
     resolving problems with in-homogeneous paths if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/automount.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">automount(8)</A></B>
     is used:

     =====================================================
     # Path Aliasing File
     # src-path   sub-host   exec-host   replacement
     /tmp_mnt/    *          *           /
     # replaces any occurrence of /tmp_mnt/ by /
     # if submitting or executing on any host.
     # Thus paths on nfs server and clients are the same
     =====================================================
