NAME
     accounting - Sun Grid Engine accounting file format

DESCRIPTION
     An accounting record is  written  to  the  Sun  Grid  Engine
     accounting file for each job having finished. The accounting
     file is processed by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qacct.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qacct(1)</A></B> to derive  accounting  statis-
     tics.

FORMAT
     Each job is represented by a line in  the  accounting  file.
     Empty  lines  and  lines which contain one character or less
     are ignored.  Accounting record  entries  are  separated  by
     colon  (':')  signs.  The  entries  denote in their order of
     appearance:

  qname
     Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.

  hostname
     Name of the execution host.

  group
     The effective group id of the job owner when  executing  the
     job.

  owner
     Owner of the Sun Grid Engine job.

  job_name
     Job name.

  job_number
     Job identifier - job number.

  account
     An account string as specified by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>  or  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qalter(1)</A></B>
     -A option.

     priority
          Priority value assigned to the job corresponding to the
          priority  parameter  in  the  queue  configuration (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).

  submission_time
     Submission time (GMT unix time stamp).

  start_time
     Start time (GMT unix time stamp).

  end_time
     End time (GMT unix time stamp).

  failed
     Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job could not
     be  started on the execution host (e.g. because the owner of
     the job did not have a valid account on  that  machine).  If
     Sun  Grid  Engine  tries to start a job multiple times, this
     may  lead  to  multiple  entries  in  the  accounting   file
     corresponding to the same job ID.

  exit_status
     Exit status of the job script (or Sun Grid  Engine  specific
     status  in  case  of  certain  error  conditions).  The exit
     status is determined by following the normal  shell  conven-
     tions.   If the command terminates normally the value of the
     command is its exit status.  However, in the case  that  the
     command  exits  abnormally,  a  value  of  0200 (octal), 128
     (decimal) is added to the value of the command  to  make  up
     the exit status.

          For example: If a job dies through signal  9  (SIGKILL)
          then the exit status becomes 128 + 9 = 137.

  ru_wallclock
     Difference between end_time and start_time (see above).

     The remainder of the accounting entries follows the contents
     of  the  standard  UNIX  rusage  structure  as  described in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/getrusage.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">getrusage(2)</A></B>.  Depending on the operating system  where  the
     job was executed some of the fields may be 0.  The following
     entries are provided:

          ru_utime
          ru_stime
          ru_maxrss
          ru_ixrss
          ru_ismrss
          ru_idrss
          ru_isrss
          ru_minflt
          ru_majflt
          ru_nswap
          ru_inblock
          ru_oublock
          ru_msgsnd
          ru_msgrcv
          ru_nsignals
          ru_nvcsw
          ru_nivcsw

  project
     The project which was assigned to the job.


  department
     The department which was assigned to the job.

  granted_pe
     The parallel environment which was selected for that job.

  slots
     The number of slots which were dispatched to the job by  the
     scheduler.

  task_number
     Array job task index number.

  cpu
     The cpu time usage in seconds.

  mem
     The integral memory usage in Gbytes cpu seconds.

  io
     The amount of data transferred in input/output operations.

  category
     A string specifying the job category.

  iow
     The io wait time in seconds.

  pe_taskid
     If this identifier is set the task was part  of  a  parallel
     job  and was passed to Sun Grid Engine via the qrsh -inherit
     interface.

  maxvmem
     The maximum vmem size in bytes.

  arid
     Advance reservation identifier. If the job used resources of
     an  advance  reservation then this field contains a positive
     integer identifier otherwise the value is "0" .

  ar_submission_time
     If the job used resources of  an  advance  reservation  then
     this  field  contains  the  submission  time  (GMT unix time
     stamp) of the advance reservation, otherwise  the  value  is
     "0" .
