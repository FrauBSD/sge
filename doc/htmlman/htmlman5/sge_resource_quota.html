NAME
     SGE_resource_quota - Sun Grid  Engine  resource  quota  file
     format

DESCRIPTION
     Resource quota sets (rqs) are a flexible way to set  a  max-
     imum  resource  consumption  for  any job requests. They are
     used by the scheduler to select the next possible  jobs  for
     running.   The  job  request distinction is done by a set of
     user, project, cluster queue, host and pe filter criteria.

     By using the resource quota sets administrators are  allowed
     to define a fine granular resource quota configuration. This
     helps restricting some job requests  to  a  lesser  resource
     usage  and  granting  other  job  requests a higher resource
     usage.

     Note: Jobs requesting an Advance Reservation  (AR)  are  not
     honored  by  Resource  Quotas and are neither subject of the
     resulting limit, nor are debited in the usage consumption.

     A list of currently configured rqs can be displayed via  the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>  -srqsl  option.  The  contents  of each listed rqs
     definition can be shown via the  -srqs  switch.  The  output
     follows  the  <I>SGE</I>_<I>resource</I>_<I>quota</I> format description. New rqs
     can be created and existing can be modified via  the  -arqs,
     -mrqs and -drqs options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>.

     A resource quota set defines a maximum resource quota for  a
     particular  job  request.  All  of  the configured rule sets
     apply all of the time. This means that if multiple  resource
     quota sets are defined, the most restrictive set is used.

     Every resource quota set consist of  one  or  more  resource
     quota  rules.  These  rules  are evaluated in order, and the
     first rule that matches a specific request will be  used.  A
     resource  quota  set always results in at most one effective
     resource quota rule for a specific request.

     Note, Sun Grid Engine allows  backslashes  (\)  be  used  to
     escape  newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the
     newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any
     interpretation.

FORMAT
     A resource  quota  set  definition  contains  the  following
     parameters:

  name
     The resource quota set name.


  enabled
     If set to <I>true</I> the resource quota set is active and will  be
     considered  for  scheduling  decisions. The default value is
     <I>false</I>.

  description
     This description field is optional and can be set  to  arbi-
     trary string. The default value is <I>NONE</I>.

  limit
     Every resource quota set needs at least one  resource  quota
     rule definition started by the limit field. It's possible to
     define more resource quota rules divided by a new  line.   A
     resource  quota  rule  consists  of  an  optional  name, the
     filters for a specific job request and  the  resource  quota
     limit.

     By default, the expressed limit counts for the entire filter
     scope. To express a filter-scope-specific limit, it's possi-
     ble to define an expanded list by setting the  list  between
     '{' '}'. It's only possible to set one complete filter in an
     expanded list.  The tags for  expressing  a  resource  quota
     rule are:

     name The name of the rule. The use  is  optional.  The  rule
          name must be unique in one resource quota set.

     users
          Contains a comma separated list of UNIX users  or  ACLs
          (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>).  This parameter filters for jobs
          by a user in the list or one of the ACLs in  the  list.
          Any user not in the list will not be considered for the
          resource quota rule. The default value  is  '*',  which
          means  any  user.  An ACL is differentiated from a UNIX
          user name by prefixing the ACL name with an  '@'  sign.
          To exclude a user or ACL from the rule, the name can be
          prefixed with the '!' sign. Defined UNIX  user  or  ACL
          names  need  not be known in the Sun Grid Engine confi-
          guration.

     projects
          Contains a comma separated list of projects  (see  <I>pro-</I>
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/ject.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">ject(5)</A></B>).  This parameter filters for jobs requesting a
          project in the list. Any project not in the  list  will
          not  be  considered  for the resource quota rule. If no
          project filter is specified, all projects and jobs with
          no  requested  project  match  the  rule. The value '*'
          means all jobs with requested projects.  To  exclude  a
          project  from  the  rule, the name can be prefixed with
          the '!' sign.  The value '!*' means only jobs  with  no
          project requested.

     pes  Contains a comma separated list of PEs (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_pe(5)</A></B>).
          This  parameter filters for jobs requesting a pe in the
          list. Any PE not in the list will not be considered for
          the  resource quota rule. If no pe filter is specified,
          all pe and jobs with no requested pe matches the  rule.
          The  value  '*'  means  all  jobs with requested pe. To
          exclude a pe from the rule, the name  can  be  prefixed
          with  the '!' sign. The value '!*' means only jobs with
          no pe requested.

     queues
          Contains a comma separated list of cluster queues  (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).   This  parameter filters for jobs that
          may be scheduled in a queue in the list.  Any queue not
          in  the  list  will  not be considered for the resource
          quota rule. The default value is '*', which  means  any
          queue.  To  exclude a queue from the rule, the name can
          be prefixed with the '!' sign.

     hosts
          Contains a comma separated list of host  or  hostgroups
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">host(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/hostgroup.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">hostgroup(5)</A></B>).  This parameter filters
          for jobs that may be scheduled in a host in the list or
          a  host  contained in a hostgroup in the list. Any host
          not in the list will not be considered for the resource
          quota  rule.  The default value is '*', which means any
          hosts. To exclude a host or hostgroup  from  the  rule,
          the name can be prefixed with the

     to   This mandatory field defines  the  quota  for  resource
          attributes for this rule. The quota is expressed by one
          or more limit definitions separated by commas. The con-
          figuration allows two kind of limits definitions

          static limits
               Static limits sets static values as  quotas.  Each
               limits consists of a complex attribute followed by
               an "=" sign and the value specification  compliant
               with the complex attribute type (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>).

          dynamic limits
               A dynamic limit is a simple  algebraic  expression
               used to derive the limit value. To be dynamic, the
               formula can reference a  complex  attribute  whose
               value is used for the calculation of the resulting
               limit.  The formula expression syntax is that of a
               sum of weighted complex values, that is:

               {w1|$complex1[*w1]}[{+|-}{w2|$complex2[*w2]}[{+|-}...]]

               The  weighting  factors  (w1,  ...)  are  positive
               integers  or  floating  point  numbers  in  double
               precision. The complex values (complex1, ...)  are
               specified  by the name defined as type INT or DOU-
               BLE in the complex list (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>).
               Note: Dynamic limits can  only  configured  for  a
               host-specific rule.

     Please note that resource quotas are  not  enforced  as  job
     resource  limits.  Limiting for example h_vmem in a resource
     quota set does not result in a memory limit  being  set  for
     job execution.

EXAMPLES
     The following is the simplest form of a resource quota  set.
     It  restricts  all  users together to the maximal use of 100
     slots in the whole cluster.

     =======================================================================
     {
        name         max_u_slots
        description  "All users max use of 100 slots"
        enabled      true
        limit        to slots=100
     }
     =======================================================================


     The  next  example  restricts  user1   and   user2   to   6g
     virtual_free  and  all  other users to the maximal use of 4g
     virtual_free on every host in hostgroup lx_hosts.

     =======================================================================
     {
        name         max_virtual_free_on_lx_hosts
        description  "resource quota for virtual_free restriction"
        enabled      true
        limit        users {user1,user2} hosts {@lx_host} to virtual_free=6g
        limit        users {*} hosts {@lx_host} to virtual_free=4g
     }
     =======================================================================


     The next example shows the use of a dynamic limit.  It  res-
     tricts  all  users  together  to a maximum use of the double
     size of num_proc.

     =======================================================================
     {
        name         max_slots_on_every_host
        enabled      true
        limit        hosts {*} to slots=$num_proc*2
     }
     =======================================================================
