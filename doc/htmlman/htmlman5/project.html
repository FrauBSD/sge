NAME
     project - Sun Grid Engine project entry file format

DESCRIPTION
     Jobs can be submitted to projects,  and  a  project  can  be
     assigned  with  a  certain level of importance via the func-
     tional or the override policy. This level of  importance  is
     then inherited by the jobs executing under that project.

     A list of currently configured projects can be displayed via
     the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>  -sprjl  option. The contents of each enlisted
     project definition can be shown via the  -sprj  switch.  The
     output  follows the <I>project</I> format description. New projects
     can be created and existing can be modified via  the  -aprj,
     -mprj and -dprj options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>.

     Note, Sun Grid Engine allows  backslashes  (\)  be  used  to
     escape  newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the
     newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any
     interpretation.

     A project definition contains the following parameters:

  name
     The  project   name   as   defined   for   <I>project</I>_<I>name</I>   in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

  oticket
     The amount of override tickets  currently  assigned  to  the
     project.

     referring to those users being allowed to submit jobs to the
     project.

     to  submit  jobs  to  the project except for those listed in
     xacl parameter described below.
