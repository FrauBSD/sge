NAME
     hostgroup - host group entry file format

DESCRIPTION
     A host group entry is used to merge host  names  to  groups.
     Each   host   group  entry  file defines one group. Inside a
     group definition file you  can  also  reference  to  groups.
     These  groups are called subgroups. A subgroup is referenced
     by the sign "@" as first character of the name.

     A list of currently configured host  group  entries  can  be
     displayed  via  the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B> -shgrpl option. The contents of
     each enlisted host group entry can be shown via  the  -shgrp
     switch. The output follows the <I>hostgroup</I> format description.
     New host group entries can be created and  existing  can  be
     modified  via  the -ahgrp, -mhgrp, -dhgrp and -?attr options
     to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>.

     Note, Sun Grid Engine allows  backslashes  (\)  be  used  to
     escape  newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the
     newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any
     interpretation.

FORMAT
     A host group entry contains following parameters:

  group_name
     The group_name defines the host group name. Host group names
     have  to  begin  with  an  '@'  character  as  explained for
     <I>hostgroup</I>_<I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(5)</A></B>.

  hostlist
     The name of all hosts and host groups  (see  <I>host</I>_<I>identifier</I>
     in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>)  which  are  member  of the group. As list
     separators white-spaces are supported  only.  Default  value
     for this parameter is NONE.

     Note, if the first character of the  <I>host</I>_<I>identifier</I>  is  an
     "@"  sign the name is used to reference a <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/hostgroup.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">hostgroup(5)</A></B> which
     is taken as sub group of this group.


EXAMPLE
     This is a typical host group entry:


     group_name @bigMachines

     hostlist @solaris64 @solaris32 fangorn balrog

     The entry will define a new host group called  @bigMachines.
     In  this  host  group  are  the host fangorn, balrog and all
     members of the host groups @solaris64 and @solaris32.
