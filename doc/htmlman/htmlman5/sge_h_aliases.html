NAME
     sge_h_aliases - Grid Engine host aliases file format

DESCRIPTION
     All Grid Engine components use a hostname resolving  service
     provided  by the communication library to identify hosts via
     a unique hostname. The communication library  itself  refer-
     ences  standard UNIX directory services such as DNS, NIS and
     /etc/hosts to resolve hostnames. In rare cases  these  stan-
     dard  services  cannot be setup cleanly and Grid Engine com-
     munication daemons running on different hosts are unable  to
     automatically  determine  a  unique  hostname for one or all
     hosts which can be used on all hosts. In such  situations  a
     Grid  Engine  host  aliases  file can be used to provide the
     communication daemons with a private and consistent hostname
     resolution database.

     The   location   for    the    host    aliases    file    is
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>host</I>_<I>aliases</I>.

FORMAT
     For each host a single line must be provided with  a  blank,
     comma  or  semicolon separated list of hostname aliases. The
     first alias is defined to be the unique hostname which  will
     be  used  by  all  Grid Engine components using the hostname
     aliasing service of the communication library.
