NAME
     host_aliases - Sun Grid Engine host aliases file format

DESCRIPTION
     All Sun Grid Engine components use a hostname resolving ser-
     vice provided by the communication library to identify hosts
     via a unique  hostname.  The  communication  library  itself
     references standard UNIX directory services such as DNS, NIS
     and /etc/hosts to resolve hostnames.  In  rare  cases  these
     standard  services  cannot  be  setup  cleanly  and Sun Grid
     Engine communication daemons running on different hosts  are
     unable  to automatically determine a unique hostname for one
     or all hosts which can be used on all hosts. In such  situa-
     tions  a  Sun  Grid  Engine host aliases file can be used to
     provide the communication daemons with a  private  and  con-
     sistent hostname resolution database.

     The   location   for    the    host    aliases    file    is
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>host</I>_<I>aliases</I>.

FORMAT
     For each host a single line must be provided with  a  blank,
     comma  or  semicolon separated list of hostname aliases. The
     first alias is defined to be the unique hostname which  will
     be used by all Sun Grid Engine components using the hostname
     aliasing service of the communication library.
