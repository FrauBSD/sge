NAME
     access_list - Sun Grid Engine access list file format

DESCRIPTION
     Access lists are used in Sun Grid Engine  to  define  access
     permissions of users to queues (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) or paral-
     lel environments (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_pe(5)</A></B>).  A list of currently  con-
     figured  access lists can be displayed via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B> -sul
     option. The contents of each enlisted access list can  shown
     via  the -su switch. The output follows the <I>access</I>_<I>list</I> for-
     mat description. New access lists can be created and  exist-
     ing can be modified via the -au and -du options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>.

     Departments are a special form of access list that addition-
     ally  allow  assignment  of  functional  shares and override
     tickets.

     Note, Sun Grid Engine allows  backslashes  (\)  be  used  to
     escape  newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the
     newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any
     interpretation.

FORMAT
     The following list of <I>access</I>_<I>list</I> parameters  specifies  the
     <I>access</I>_<I>list</I> content:

  name
     The name of the access list as defined for  <I>userset</I>_<I>name</I>  in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

  type
     The type of the access list, currently  one  of <I>ACL</I>, or <I>DEPT</I>
     or a  combination of both in a comma separated list. Depend-
     ing on this parameter the access list can be used as  access
     list only or as a department.

  oticket
     The amount of override tickets  currently  assigned  to  the
     department.

  fshare
     The current functional share of the department.

  entries
     The entries parameter contains the comma separated  list  of
     those  UNIX  users  (see <I>user</I>_<I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>) or those
     primary UNIX groups that are assigned to the access list  or
     the  department.  Only  a user's primary UNIX group is used;
     secondary  groups  are  ignored.  Only  symbolic  names  are
     allowed.  A group is differentiated from a user name by pre-
     fixing the group name with a '@'  sign.  Pure  access  lists
     allow enlisting any user or group in any access list.
     When using departments, each user or group enlisted may only
     be  enlisted  in one department, in order to ensure a unique
     assignment of jobs to departments. To jobs  whose  users  do
     not  match  with  any  of the users or groups enlisted under
     entries the <I>defaultdepartment</I> is assigned, if existing.
