NAME
     bootstrap - Sun Grid Engine bootstrap file

DESCRIPTION
     <I>bootstrap</I>  contains  parameters  that  are  needed  for  the
     startup of Sun Grid Engine components.  It is created during
     the sge_qmaster installation.  Modifying <I>bootstrap</I> in a run-
     ning system is not supported.

FORMAT
     The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of the
     individual  parameters that compose the bootstrap configura-
     tion for a Sun Grid Engine cluster:

  admin_user
     Administrative user account used by Sun Grid Engine for  all
     internal  file  handling  (status spooling, message logging,
     etc.). Can be used in cases where the root account does  not
     have  the  corresponding  file access permissions (e.g. on a
     shared file system without global root read/write access).

     Being  a  parameter  set  at  installation   time   changing
     admin_user in a running system is not supported. Changing it
     manually on a shut-down cluster is possible, but  if  access
     to  the  Sun  Grid Engine spooling area is interrupted, this
     will result in unpredictable behavior.

     The admin_user parameter has no default value,  but  instead
     it is defined during the master installation procedure.

  default_domain
     Only needed if your Sun Grid  Engine  cluster  covers  hosts
     belonging  to more than a single DNS domain. In this case it
     can be used if your hostname resolving yields both qualified
     and  unqualified  hostnames  for the hosts in one of the DNS
     domains. The value of  default_domain  is  appended  to  the
     unqualified  hostname  to define a fully qualified hostname.
     The  default_domain  parameter  will  have  no   effect   if
     ignore_fqdn is set to "true".

     Being  a  parameter  set  at  installation   time   changing
     default_domain  in  a  running  system is not supported. The
     default for default_domain is "none", in which case it  will
     not be used.

  ignore_fqdn
     Ignore fully qualified domain name component  of  hostnames.
     Should  be  set  if all hosts belonging to a Sun Grid Engine
     cluster are part of a single DNS domain. It is  switched  on
     if  set  to  either "true" or "1". Switching it on may solve
     problems with load reports due to different hostname resolu-
     tions across the cluster.
     Being  a  parameter  set  at  installation   time   changing
     ignore_fqdn  in  a  running  system  is  not  supported. The
     default for ignore_fqdn is "true".

  spooling_method
     Defines how <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> writes its configuration and  the
     status information of a running cluster.

     The available spooling methods are <I>berkeleydb</I> and <I>classic</I>.

  spooling_lib
     The name of a shared library containing the  spooling_method
     to  be  loaded  at  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> initialization time.  The
     extension characterizing a shared library (.so, .sl,  .dylib
     etc.) is not contained in spooling_lib.

     If spooling_method was set to  <I>berkeleydb</I>  during  installa-
     tion,  spooling_lib  is  set  to  <I>libspoolb</I>,  if <I>classic</I> was
     chosen as spooling_method, spooling_lib is set to <I>libspoolc</I>.

     Not all operating  systems  allow  the  dynamic  loading  of
     libraries.  On  these  platforms  a  certain spooling method
     (default: berkeleydb) is compiled into the binaries and  the
     parameter spooling_lib will be ignored.

  spooling_params
     Defines parameters to the chosen spooling method.

     Parameters that are needed to initialize the spooling frame-
     work, e.g. to open database files or to connect to a certain
     database server.

     The spooling parameters value for spooling method <I>berkeleydb</I>
     is        [rpc_server:]database        directory,       e.g.
     /sge_local/default/spool/qmaster/spooldb for spooling  to  a
     local filesystem, or myhost:sge for spooling over a Berkeley
     DB RPC server.

     For spooling method <I>classic</I> the spooling parameters take the
     form      &lt;common_dir&gt;;&lt;qmaster     spool     dir&gt;,     e.g.
     /sge/default/common;/sge/default/spool/qmaster

  binary_path
     The directory  path  where  the  Sun  Grid  Engine  binaries
     reside.  It  is  used  within  Sun Grid Engine components to
     locate and startup other Sun Grid Engine programs.

     The path name given here is searched for binaries as well as
     any  directory  below  with  a  directory  name equal to the
     current   operating    system    architecture.    Therefore,
     /usr/SGE/bin   will  work  for  all  architectures,  if  the
     corresponding binaries are located in  subdirectories  named
     aix43, cray, lx24-x86, hp11, irix65, tru64, sol-sparc, etc.

     The default location for the binary path is &lt;sge_root&gt;/bin

  qmaster_spool_dir
     The location where the master spool directory resides.  Only
     the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shadowd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_shadowd(8)</A></B> need to have access to
     this directory. The master spool directory -  in  particular
     the  job_scripts  directory  and the messages log file - may
     become quite large depending on the size of the cluster  and
     the  number  of  jobs. Be sure to allocate enough disk space
     and regularly clean off the log files, e.g.  via  a  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/cron.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">cron(8)</A></B>
     job.

     Being  a  parameter  set  at  installation   time   changing
     qmaster_spool_dir in a running system is not supported.

     The default location  for  the  master  spool  directory  is
     &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/spool/qmaster.

  security_mode
     The security mode defines the set of security  features  the
     installed cluster is using.

     Possible security mode settings are  none,  afs,  dce,  ker-
     beros,  csp.   (no  additional security, AFS, DCE, KERBEROS,
     CSP security model).

  listener_threads
     The number of listener threads (defaults  set  by  installa-
     tion).

  worker_threads
     The number of worker threads (defaults set by installation).

  scheduler_threads
     The number of scheduler threads (allowed: 0-1,  default  set
     by installation: 1, off: 0).  (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B> -kt/-at option)

  jvm_threads
     The number of jvm threads (allowed: 0-1, default set by ins-
     tallation, off: 0).
