NAME
     user - Sun Grid Engine user entry file format

DESCRIPTION
     A user entry is used to store ticket and  usage  information
     on  a per user basis. Maintaining user entries for all users
     participating in a Sun Grid Engine system is required if Sun
     Grid Engine is operated under a user share tree policy.

     If the enforce_user cluster configuration parameter  is  set
     to  <I>auto</I>,  a  user  object  for  the submitting user will be
     created automatically during job submission, if one does not
     already   exist.  The  auto_user_oticket,  auto_user_fshare,
     auto_user_default_project, and auto_user_delete_time cluster
     configuration  parameters will be used as default attributes
     of the new user object.

     A list of currently configured user entries can be displayed
     via  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>  -suserl  option.  The  contents  of each
     enlisted user entry can be shown via the -suser switch.  The
     output follows the <I>user</I> format description. New user entries
     can be created and existing can be modified via the  -auser,
     -muser and -duser options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>.

     Note, Sun Grid Engine allows  backslashes  (\)  be  used  to
     escape  newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the
     newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any
     interpretation.

FORMAT
     A user entry contains four parameters:

  name
     The user name as defined for <I>user</I>_<I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

  oticket
     The amount of override tickets  currently  assigned  to  the
     user.

  fshare
     The current functional share of the user.

  default_project
     The default project of the user.

  delete_time
     Note: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
     The  wall-clock  time  when  this  user  will  be   deleted,
     expressed  as the number of seconds elapsed since January 1,
     1970. If set to zero, the affected user is a permanent user.
     If  set  to  one,  the  user currently has active jobs.  For
     additional information about  automatically  created  users,
     see the enforce_user and auto_user_delete_time parameters in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.
