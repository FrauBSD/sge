NAME
     usermapping - user mapping entry file format

DESCRIPTION
     A usermapping entry is used to  define  alias  names  for  a
     cluster user. The user's name known by the scheduling system
     is known as the cluster user. If the  cluster  user  doesn't
     match  the user account name on an execution host, the user-
     mapping feature can solve the problem.

     Each line in the usermapping entry  file  specifies  a  user
     name and the host(s) where he has an account.

     A list of currently configured user mapping entries  can  be
     displayed  via  the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B> -sumapl option. The contents of
     each enlisted user mapping entry can be shown via the -sumap
     switch.  The  output follows the <I>usermapping</I> format descrip-
     tion. New user entries can be created and  existing  can  be
     modified  via  the  -aumap,  -mumap  and  -dumap  options to
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qconf(1)</A></B>.

FORMAT
     A user mapping entry contains two parameters:

  cluster_user
     The cluster_user keyword defines the cluster user name.  The
     rest  of  the textline after the keyword "cluster_user" will
     be taken as cluster user value.


  remote_user
     The user name on an execution host.  Please  note  that  the
     value  for this attribute might be overwritten for a certain
     hostgroups or single host.  Find an example below.



EXAMPLE
     This is a typical user mapping entry for a cluster user map-
     ping:


     cluster_user   peter

     remote_user    peter,[@linux=pet1],[fangorn=peter1]

     The entry will map the user peter which is  defined  in  the
     cluster system to the user peter on all hosts in the cluster
     except for all hosts which are referenced in  the  hostgroup
     @linux. For all these hosts the user will be mapped to pet1.
     For the host fangorn the remote user will be peter1.   <I>host-</I>
