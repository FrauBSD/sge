NAME
     qtcsh - tcsh v6.09 with transparent remote execution by  use
     of qrsh.

SYNTAX
     qtcsh [ tcsh options | -ABLR ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qtcsh</I> is an extension to the popular <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">csh(1)</A></B> derivative <I>tcsh</I>.
     It  allows the transparent remote execution commands entered
     in <I>qtcsh</I> controlled via Sun Grid Engine.  <I>Qtcsh</I> can be  used
     as  interactive  command interpreter as well as for the pro-
     cessing of <I>tcsh</I> shell scripts.

     When invoked, <I>qtcsh</I> identifies which commands are to be  run
     remotely  and  which  are  not.  For  this purpose the files
     &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/qtask and ~/.qtask  are  processed.
     Each  line in these files defines a command that is intended
     to be run remotely (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtask(5)</A></B> for  a  definition  of  the
     file  format).  The .qtask file in the user's home directory
     contains the user's remote  task  specification,  while  the
     file  in  the common directory is maintained by the adminis-
     trator and defines a  cluster-wide  default  behavior.   The
     contents  of  the  administrator  supplied <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtask(5)</A></B> file are
     completely overridden in case there is an appropriate  entry
     in  the  users  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtask(5)</A></B> file.  This is prevented in case an
     exclamation mark is prefixed to  the  command  name  in  the
     administrators qtask file.

     <I>Qtcsh</I> always attempts to start the designated tasks remotely
     via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B>.  Exceptions are

     <B>o</B>  if the user enters such commands via a relative or  abso-
        lute  pathname  instead  of  the stand-alone command name
        (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtask(5)</A></B> for more information).

     <B>o</B>  if the environment variable JOB_ID is set and thus  <I>qtcsh</I>
        assumes  that execution already happens remotely within a
        Sun Grid Engine job and thus executes tasks locally. This
        avoids  unwanted  recursions but can be overridden by the
        command-line option -R and the built-in command  <I>qrshmode</I>
        -<I>R</I> (see corresponding descriptions below).

     <B>o</B>  if <I>qtcsh</I> cannot establish a connection of Sun Grid Engine
        during  start-up. This allows to use <I>qtcsh</I> as login shell
        without the danger of being  blocked  when  no  Sun  Grid
        Engine service is available.

     <I>Qtcsh</I> can  operate  in  three  different  modes  determining
     whether

     <B>o</B>  tasks are executed remotely.
     <B>o</B>  immediate or batch execution is requested.

     <B>o</B>  status output is verbose or only in case of any errors.

     These modes either can be  controlled  by  the  command-line
     switches  described  below during <I>qtcsh</I> invocation or within
     an executing <I>qtcsh</I> via  the  built-in  command  <I>qrshmode</I>  as
     described in section BUILT-IN COMMANDS.

OPTIONS
     The options enlisted below are special to <I>qtcsh</I>. The user is
     referred to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/tcsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">tcsh(1)</A></B> documentation for the explanation of
     further options.


     -A   Switches <I>qtcsh</I> in verbose mode causing diagnostic  out-
          put in case of remote execution.

     -B   Switches remote task execution  to  batch  mode.  Tasks
          submitted  to  Sun  Grid  Engine will be queued if they
          cannot start immediately.  As a consequence, <I>qtcsh</I>  may
          block  until the queued task can be started by Sun Grid
          Engine. While this  behavior  probably  is  undesirable
          during  an  interactive  session, it may be very useful
          for execution of shell  scripts  through  <I>qtcsh</I>  as  it
          avoids  failure  of the scripts due to temporarily una-
          vailable resources for particular tasks.

     -L   Switches off default behavior of  remote  execution  of
          commands.  Causes  all  commands to be executed locally
          even if they are  contained  in  one  of  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qtask(5)</A></B>
          files.

     -R   Enforces remote execution of commands even if JOB_ID is
          set as environment variable.

BUILT-IN COMMANDS
     This section only describes additional  shell  builtin  com-
     mands which are not available in standard <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/tcsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">tcsh(1)</A></B>.


     qrshmode [-ANBILR]
          Without options, the current operational mode of  <I>qtcsh</I>
          is displayed. The options have the following effect:

          -A   switch to verbose output mode
          -N   switch to non-verbose output mode
          -B   switch to batch execution mode
          -I   switch to immediate execution mode
          -L   always execute commands locally
          -R   execute configured commands remotely

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell. To address a Sun Grid Engine cell <I>qtcsh</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

     JOB_ID         If set when starting <I>qtcsh</I> the  local  opera-
                    tion  mode  is activated implicitly as if the
                    -L option was specified.

FILES
     ~/.<I>qtask</I>       user qtask file.
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>qtask</I>
                    cluster qtask file.
