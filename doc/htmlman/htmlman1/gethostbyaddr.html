NAME
     gethostname   -
               get local hostname.

     gethostbyname -
               get local host information for specified hostname.

     gethostbyaddr -
               get hostname via IP address.

     getservbyname -
               get configured port number of service

SYNTAX
     gethostname [-help|-name|-aname|-all]

     gethostbyname [-help|-name|-aname|-all] &lt;name&gt;

     gethostbyaddr [-help|-name|-aname|-all] &lt;ip&gt;

     getservbyname [-help|-number] &lt;service&gt;

DESCRIPTION
     <I>gethostname</I> and <I>gethostbyname</I> are  used  to  get  the  local
     resolved  host name.  <I>gethostbyaddr</I> is used to get the host-
     name of a specified IP address  (dotted  decimal  notation).
     <I>getservbyname</I>  can be used to get the configured port number
     of a service (e.g. from /etc/services).

     The hostname utils are primarily used by the Sun Grid Engine
     installation   scripts.   <I>gethostname</I>  ,  <I>gethostbyname</I>  and
     <I>gethostbyaddr</I> called without any option will print  out  the
     hostname,  all  specified aliases, and the IP address of the
     locally resolved hostname.   Calling  <I>getservbyname</I>  without
     any option will print out the full service entry.

OPTIONS
  -help
     Prints a list of all options.

  -name
     This option only reports the primary name of the host.

  -aname
     If this option is set, the Sun Grid Engine host  alias  file
     is  used for host name resolving. It is necessary to set the
     environment variable SGE_ROOT and, if more than one cell  is
     defined, also SGE_CELL.

     This option will print out the Sun Grid Engine host name.


  -all
     By using the -all option all available host information will
     be  printed.   This  information includes the host name, the
     Sun Grid Engine host name, all  host  aliases,  and  the  IP
     address of the host.

  -number
     This option will print out the port number of the  specified
     service name.

  &lt;name&gt;
     The host name for which the information is requested.

  &lt;ip&gt;
     The IP address  (dotted  decimal  notation)  for  which  the
     information is requested.

  &lt;service&gt;
     The service name for  which  the  information  is  requested
     (e.g. ftp, sge_qmaster or sge_execd).

EXAMPLES
     The following example shows how to get the  port  number  of
     the FTP service:

          &gt;getservbyname -number ftp
          21

     The next example shows the output of gethostname  -all  when
     the host alias file contains this line:

     gridmaster extern_name extern_name.mydomain

     The local host resolving must also provide  the  alias  name
     "gridmaster".  Each  Sun  Grid Engine host that wants to use
     the cluster must be able to resolve the host name  "gridmas-
     ter".

     To setup an alias name, edit your /etc/hosts file or  modify
     your NIS setup to provide the alias for the NIS clients.

     The host alias file must be readable  from  each  host  (use
     e.g. NFS shared file location).

          &gt;gethostname -all
          Hostname: extern_name.mydomain
          SGE name: gridmaster
          Aliases:  loghost gridmaster
          Host Address(es): 192.168.143.99

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell.
