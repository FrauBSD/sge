NAME
     qrsub   - Submit an Advance Reservation  (AR)  to  Sun  Grid
               Engine.

SYNTAX
     qrsub [-a date_time] [-A account_string]  [-ckpt  ckpt_name]
     [-d   time]   [-e   date_time]   [-he  yes|no]  [-help]  [-l
     resource_list] [-now] [-M user[@host],...] [-N ar_name]  [-w
     e|v]   [-pe   pe_name  slot_range]  [-q  wc_queue_list]  [-u
     wc_user_list]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qrsub</I> provides a means  for  operators,  managers  or  users
     referenced  in  the  ACL  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>) "arusers" to
     create a Advance Reservation (AR) in  the  Sun  Grid  Engine
     queuing  system.  ARs allow to reserve particular consumable
     resources for future use. These reserved resources are  only
     available  for  jobs  requesting  the  AR  and the scheduler
     ensures the availability of the  resources  when  the  start
     time  is  reached.  Job  requesting  the AR can only use the
     reserved consumable resources.

     During AR submit time the Sun  Grid  Engine  queuing  system
     selects  the  best suited queues for the AR request and then
     reserves the desired amount of resources.   For  a  reserva-
     tion,  all  queues  that  are not in orphaned state are con-
     sidered as suited. Only if the AR request can be  fulfilled,
     the AR will be granted.

     ARs will be deleted either automatically when the  end  time
     is  reached,  or manually using <I>qrdel</I> . In both cases, first
     all jobs requesting the AR  will  be  removed  and  then  AR
     itself. Already granted ARs can be shown with <I>qrstat</I>(.)

     Note: To make AR behavior predictable, it  is  necessary  to
     have  reserved  resources available at the time of AR start.
     This is done by keeping jobs with a unlimited runtime  limit
     separated  from  ARs,  and not considering resources used by
     such jobs for reservation.

     Note: Resource Quotas are not considered for AR queue selec-
     tion and nor for jobs requesting a AR.

     When an AR was successfully added to  the  Sun  Grid  Engine
     queuing  system  <I>qrsub</I> returns a unique integer ID referring
     the the newly created AR. The highest AR ID is  9999999.  If
     the highest ID is reached, a wraparound happens and the next
     unused ID, starting with 1, will be used.

     For <I>qrsub</I>, the administrator and the user may define default
     request  files  (analogous  to  Sun  Grid Engine_request for
     qsub), which can contain any of the  possible  command  line
     options.
     A cluster wide default request file is optional.  If such  a
     default request file is used, it must be placed under
     $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_ar_request  (global  defaults
     file).
     A user private default request file is optional.  If  it  is
     used, it must be placed under
     $HOME/.sge_ar_request (user private defaults file).

OPTIONS
     -a date_time
          Defines the activation (start) date and time of an  AR.
          The  option  is  not mandatory. If omitted, the current
          date_time  is  assumed.  Either  a  duration   or   end
          date_time  must  also  be  specified. For details about
          date_time please see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>

     -A account_string
          Identifies the account to which the  resource  reserva-
          tion  of the AR should be charged. For "account_string"
          value details  please  see  the  "name"  definition  in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.   In  the  absence  of this parameter Sun
          Grid Engine will place the default account string "sge"
          in the accounting record of the AR.

     -ckpt ckpt_name
          Selects  the  checkpointing  environment  (see   <I>check-</I>
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/point.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">point(5)</A></B>)  the  AR  jobs may request. Using this option
          guarantees queues that only providing  this  checkpoint
          environment will be reserved.

     -d time
          Defines the duration of the AR. The use of "-d time" is
          optional  if  "-e date_time" is requested.  For details
          about  "time" definition please see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

     -e date_time
          Defines the end date and time of an AR. The use of  "-e
          date_time"  is optional if "-d time" is requested.  For
          details  about  "date_time"   definition   please   see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

     -he y[es]|n[o]
          Specifies the behavior when the AR goes into  an  error
          state.  The  AR  goes  into error state when a reserved
          host goes into unknown state, a queue error happens, or
          when a queue is disabled or suspended.

          A hard error, "-he yes", means as long as the AR is  in
          error  state no jobs using the AR will be scheduled. If
          soft error, "-he no", is specified the AR stays  usable
          with the remaining resources.
          By default soft error handling is used.


     -help
          Prints a list of all options.

     -l resource=value,...
          Creates an AR in a Sun Grid Engine queue, providing the
          given  resource request list.  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B> describes how
          a list of  available  resources  and  their  associated
          valid value specifiers can be obtained.
          There may be multiple -l switches in a single command.

     -m b|e|a|n
          Defines or redefines under which circumstances mail  is
          to be sent to the AR owner or to the users defined with
          the -M option described  below.  The  option  arguments
          have the following meaning:

          `b'     Mail is sent at the beginning of the AR
          `e'     Mail is sent at the end of the AR
          `a'     Mail is sent when the AR goes into error state
          `n'     No mail is sent, default for <I>qrsub</I>

     -M user[@host],...
          Defines or redefines the list of  users  to  which  the
          qmaster sends mail.

     -masterq wc_queue_list
          Only meaningful for a parallel AR request together with
          the -pe option.

          This option is used to reserve  the  proper  queues  to
          match  this request if it would be requested by a qsub.
          A more detailed description  of  <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>_<I>list</I>  can  be
          found in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

     -now y[es]|n[o]
          This options impacts the queues selection for  reserva-
          tion.
          With the "-now y" option, only queues  with  the  qtype
          "INTERACTIVE"  assigned will be considered for reserva-
          tion.  "-now n" is the default for <I>qrsub</I>.

     -N name
          The name of the AR. The name, if requested,  must  con-
          form  to  "name"  as  defined in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  Invalid
          names will be denied at submit time.

     -w e|v
          Specifies  the  validation  level  applied  to  the  AR
          request.
          The specifiers e and v define the following  validation
          modes:

          `v'  verify - does not submit the AR but prints
               an extensive validation report
          `e'  error - rejects request if requirements cannot
               be fulfilled, default for <I>qrsub</I>

     -pe parallel_env n[-[m]]|[-]m,...
          Parallel programming environment (PE) to select for the
          AR queue reservation. Please see the details of a PE in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_pe(5)</A></B>.

     -q wc_queue_list
          Defines or redefines a list of  cluster  queues,  queue
          domains or queue instances, that may be reserved by the
          AR. Please  find  a  description  of  <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>_<I>list</I>  in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  This parameter has all the properties of
          a resource request and will be merged with requirements
          derived from the -l option described above.

     -u [username|@access_list],...
          Defines the users allowed to submit jobs requesting the
          AR.  The  access is specified by a comma separated list
          containing UNIX users  or  ACLs  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>).
          prefixing the ACL name with an '@' sign.
          By default only the AR owner is allowed to submit  jobs
          requesting the AR.

          Note: Only queues, where all  users  specified  in  the
          list  have  access, are considered for reservation (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell.  To  address  a  Sun  Grid Engine cell,
                    <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> or <I>qalter</I> use (in the order
                    of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.

     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  TCP  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead of defining the port.
