NAME
     qmod - modify a Sun Grid Engine queue and running job

SYNTAX
     qmod [ options ] [ wc_job_range_list | wc_queue_list ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qmod</I> enables users classified as <I>owners</I>  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>
     for  details)  of  a  workstation to modify the state of Sun
     Grid Engine queues for his/her machine as well as the  state
     of his/her own jobs.  A manager/operator or root can execute
     <I>qmod</I> for any queue and job in a cluster but only from admin-
     istrative  hosts.   Find  additional  information concerning
     <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>_<I>list</I> and <I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>_<I>list</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

OPTIONS
     -c   Note: Deprecated, may be  removed  in  future  release.
          Please use the -cj or -cq switch instead.
          Clears   the   error    state    of    the    specified
          jobs(s)/queue(s).

     -cj  Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s).

     -cq  Clears the error state of the specified queue(s).

     -d   Disables  the  queue(s),  i.e.  no  further  jobs   are
          dispatched  to  disabled queues while jobs already exe-
          cuting in these queues are allowed to finish.

     -e   Enables the queue(s).

     -f   Force the modification action for the queue despite the
          apparent  current  state of the queue. For example if a
          queue appears to be suspended  but  the  job  execution
          seems to be continuing the manager/operator can force a
          suspend operation which will  send  a  SIGSTOP  to  the
          jobs.  In any case, the queue or job status will be set
          even if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  controlling  the  queues/jobs
          cannot    be    reached.    Requires   manager/operator
          privileges.

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -r   Note: Deprecated, may be  removed  in  future  release.
          Please use the -rj or -rq switch instead.
          If applied to queues, reschedules  all  jobs  currently
          running  in  this  queue.   If applied to running jobs,
          reschedules  the  jobs.  Requires   root   or   manager
          privileges.   In  order for a job to be rescheduled, it
          or the queue in which it is  executing  must  have  the
          rerun  flag  activated.   (See -r option in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>
          man page and the <I>rerun</I> option in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>  man
          page  for  more  information.)  Additional restrictions
          apply for parallel and checkpointing  jobs.   (See  the
          <I>reschedule</I>_<I>unknown</I>  description  in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B> man
          page for details).

     -rj  If applied  to  running  jobs,  reschedules  the  jobs.
          Requires root or manager privileges.

     -rq  If applied to queues, reschedules  all  jobs  currently
          running  in  this  queue.   Requires  root  or  manager
          privileges.

     -s   Note: Deprecated, may be  removed  in  future  release.
          Please use the -sj or -sq switch instead.
          If applied to queues, suspends the queues and any  jobs
          which  might  be  active.  If  applied to running jobs,
          suspends the jobs.

     -sj  If applied to running jobs, suspends the jobs. If a job
          is  both suspended explicitly and via suspension of its
          queue, a following unsuspend  of  the  queue  will  not
          release the suspension state on the job.

     -sq  If applied to queues, suspends the queues and any  jobs
          which might be active.

     -us  Note: Deprecated, may be  removed  in  future  release.
          Please use the -usj or -usq switch instead.
          If applied to queues, unsuspends  the  queues  and  any
          jobs  which  might  be  active.  If  applied  to  jobs,
          unsuspends the jobs.

     -usj If applied to jobs, unsuspends the jobs. If  a  job  is
          both  suspended  explicitly  and  via suspension of its
          queue, a following unsuspend  of  the  queue  will  not
          release the suspension state on the job.

     -usq If applied to queues, unsuspends  the  queues  and  any
          jobs which might be active.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell.  To address a Sun Grid Engine cell <I>qmod</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.
                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
