NAME
     qrstat - show the status of Sun Grid Engine Advance Reserva-
     tions (AR)

SYNTAX
     qrstat [-ar ar_id,...] [-help] [-u user,...] [-explain]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>qrstat</I> shows the current status of the  available  Sun  Grid
     Engine  ARs.   The  selection  option  -ar allows you to get
     information about specific AR.

     The administrator and the user may define  files  which  can
     contain  any  of the options described below. A cluster-wide
     sge_qrstat      file      may      be      placed      under
     $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_qrstat The user private  file
     is searched at the  location  $HOME/.sge_qrstat.   The  home
     directory  request  file has the highest precedence over the
     cluster global file.  Command line can be used  to  override
     the flags contained in the files.

OPTIONS
     -ar ar_id,...
          Prints various information about the ARs identified  by
          given ar_id list.

     -explain
          Displays the reason for the error state of an AR.  Pos-
          sible  reasons are the unknown state of a host or queue
          instance.

          The output format for the alarm reasons is one line per
          reason.

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -u user,...
          Display information only for those ARs created  by  the
          users from the given user list.

          The string  $user is  a  placeholder  for  the  current
          username. An asterisk "*" can be used as username wild-
          card to request that all users' ARs be  displayed.  The
          default value for this switch is "-u $user".


     -xml This option can be used  with  all  other  options  and
          changes  the output to XML. The used schemas are refer-
          enced in the XML  output.  The  output  is  printed  to
          stdout.

OUTPUT FORMATS
     Depending on the presence or absence of the -ar option there
     are two output formats need to be differentiated.

  Advance Reservation Summary (without -ar)
     Following the header line, a section for  each  AR  is  pro-
     vided. The columns contain information for

     <B>o</B>  the AR id.

     <B>o</B>  the name of the AR.

     <B>o</B>  the current state of the  AR.  One  of  following  states
        'wWrEd".

        w - waiting without error
        W - warning (effective - waiting with error)
        r - running
        E - error (effective - running with error)
        d - deleted

     <B>o</B>  the start time of the AR.

     <B>o</B>  the end time of the AR.

     <B>o</B>  the duration of the AR.

  Detailed Format (with -ar)
     The output contains two columns. The first one contains  all
     AR attributes.  The second one the corresponding value.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell.  To  address  a  Sun  Grid  Engine cell
                    <I>qrstat</I> uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

FILES
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>act</I>_<I>qmaster</I>
