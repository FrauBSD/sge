NAME
     JSV - Sun Grid Engine Job Submission Verifier

DESCRIPTION
     JSV is an abbreviation for Job Submission Verifier. A JSV is
     a  script  or  binary  that can be used to verify, modify or
     reject a job during the time of job submission.

     JSVs will be triggered by submit clients  like  <I>qsub</I>,  <I>qrsh</I>,
     <I>qsh</I>  and  <I>qmon</I>  on  submit hosts (Client JSV) or they verify
     incoming jobs on the master host (Server JSV) or both.

CONFIGURATION
     JSVs can  be  configured  on  various  locations.  Either  a
     jsv_url  can be provided with the -jsv submit parameter dur-
     ing job submission, a corresponding switch can be  added  to
     one  of the sge_request files or a jsv_url can be configured
     in the global cluster configuration of the Sun  Grid  Engine
     installation.

     All defined JSV instances  will  be  executed  in  following
     order:

        1) qsub -jsv ...
        2) $cwd/.sge_request
        3) $HOME/.sge_request
        4) $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request
        5) Global configuration

     The Client JSVs (1-3) can be defined by Sun Grid Engine  end
     users   whereas   the  client  JSV  defined  in  the  global
     sge_request file (4) and the server  JSV  (5)  can  only  be
     defined by the Sun Grid Engine administrators.

     Due to the fact that (4) and (5) are defined and  configured
     by  Sun Grid Engine administrators and because they are exe-
     cuted as last JSV instances in the sequence of JSV  scripts,
     an  administrator  has  an  additional way to define certain
     policies for a cluster.

     As soon as one JSV instance rejects a job the whole  process
     of  verification  is  stopped  and  the  end user will get a
     corresponding error message that the submission of  the  job
     has failed.

     If a JSV accepts a job or accepts a  job  after  it  applied
     several  modifications  then the following JSV instance will
     get the job parameters including all modifications as  input
     for the verification process. This is done as long as either
     the job is accepted or rejected.

     for Server JSVs in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>

LIFETIME
     A Client or Server JSV is started as own UNIX process.  This
     process  communicates  either  with a Sun Grid Engine client
     process or the master daemon  by  exchanging  commands,  job
     parameters and other data via stdin/stdout channels.

     Client JSV instances  are  started  by  client  applications
     before  a job is sent to qmaster. This instance does the job
     verification for the job to be submitted. After that verifi-
     cation the JSV process is stopped.

     Server JSV instances are started for each worker thread part
     of  the  qmaster process (for version 6.2 of Sun Grid Engine
     this means that two processes are started).  Each  of  those
     processes have to verify job parameters for multiple jobs as
     long as the master is running, the underlying JSV configura-
     tion is not changed and no error occurs.

TIMEOUT
     The timeout is a modifiable  value  that  will  measure  the
     response  time  of  either  the client or server JSV. In the
     event that the response time  of  the  JSV  is  longer  than
     timeout  value  specified, this will result in the JSV being
     re-started.  The  server  JSV  timeout  value  is  specified
     through  the  qmaster  parameter jsv_timeout. The client JSV
     timeout  value  is  set  through  the  environment  variable
     SGE_JSV_TIMEOUT.  The  default value is 10 seconds, and this
     value must be greater than 0. If the timeout has been reach,
     the  JSV  will  only try to re-start once, if the timeout is
     reached again an error will occur.

THRESHOLD
     The threshold  value  is  defined  as  a  qmaster  parameter
     jsv_threshold. This value measures the time for a server job
     verification. If this time  exceeds  the  defined  threshold
     then  additional  logging  will appear in the master message
     file at the INFO level. This  value  is  specified  in  mil-
     liseconds  and  has a default value of 5000. If a value of 0
     is defined then this means all jobs will be  logged  in  the
     message file.

PROTOCOL
     After a JSV script or binary is started it will get commands
     through  its stdin stream and it has to respond with certain
     commands on the stdout stream. Data which is  send  via  the
     stderr  stream  of  a  JSV instance is ignored. Each command
     which is send to/by a JSV script has to be terminated  by  a
     new  line  character  ('\n') whereas new line characters are
     not allowed in the whole command string itself.
     In general commands which are exchanged between  a  JSV  and
     client/qmaster have following format. Commands and arguments
     are case sensitive. Find the EBNF command description below.

           command := command_name ' ' { argument ' ' } ;

     A command starts with a command_name  followed  by  a  space
     character  and a space separated list of arguments.

PROTOCOL (JSV side)
     Following commands have to be implemented by an  JSV  script
     so that it conforms to version 1.0 of the JSV protocol which
     was first implemented in Sun Grid Engine 6.2u2:

     begin_command := 'BEGIN' ;
          After a JSV instance has received all env_commands  and
          param_commands  of  a job which should be verified, the
          client/qmaster will trigger the verification process by
          sending  one begin_command. After that it will wait for
          param_commands and env_commands  which  are  sent  back
          from  the JSV instance to modify the job specification.
          As part of the verification process  a  JSV  script  or
          binary  has  to use the result_command to indicate that
          the verification process is finished for a job.

     env_command := ENV ' ' modifier ' ' name ' ' value ;

     modifier := 'ADD' | 'MOD' | 'DEL' ;
          The env_command is an optional command which  has  only
          to   be   implemented   by   a   JSV  instance  if  the
          send_data_command is sent by  this  JSV  before  a  the
          started_command  was sent. Only in that case the client
          or master will use one or multiple env_commands to pass
          the  environment  variables (name and value) to the JSV
          instance which would be exported to the job environment
          when  the job would be started. Client and qmaster will
          only sent env_commands with the modifier 'ADD'.

          JSV instances modify the set of  environment  variables
          by sending back env_commands and by using the modifiers
          ADD, MOD and DEL.

     param_command := 'PARAM' ' ' param_parameter ' ' value ;

     param_parameter := submit_parameter | pseudo_parameter ;
          The param_command has two  additional  arguments  which
          are  separated  by space characters. The first argument
          is either a submit_parameter  as  it  is  specified  in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>  or  it  is  a  pseudo_parameters as documented
          below.  The  second  parameter  is  the  value  of  the
          corresponding param_parameter.

          Multiple param_commands will be sent to a JSV  instance
          after  the  JSV  has sent a started_command. The sum of
          all param_commands  which  is  sent  represents  a  job
          specification of that job which should be verified.

          submit_parameters are for example  b  (similar  to  the
          qsub  -b  switch)  or masterq (similar to qsub -masterq
          switch). Find a complete list of  submit_parameters  in
          the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> man page. Please note that not in all cases
          the param_parameter name and  the  corresponding  value
          format  is equivalent with the qsub switch name and its
          argument format.  E.g. the qsub -pe parameters will  by
          available as a set of parameters with the name pe_name,
          pe_min, pe_max or the switch combination -soft -l  will
          be  passed  to  JSV  scripts  as  l_soft parameter. For
          details concerning this differences  consult  also  the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> man page.

     start_command := 'START' ;
          The start_command has  no  additional  arguments.  This
          command indicates that a new job verification should be
          started. It is the first command which will be sent  to
          JSV  script  after it has been started and it will ini-
          tiate each new job verification. A JSV  instance  might
          trash  cached  values  which  are still stored due to a
          previous job verification. The application  which  send
          the  start_command  will  wait  for  a  started_command
          before it continues.

     quit_command := 'QUIT' ;
          The quit_command has no additional arguments.  If  this
          command  is  sent to a JSV instance then it should ter-
          minate itself immediately.

PROTOCOL (client/qmaster side)
     A JSV script or binary can send  a  set  of  commands  to  a
     client/qmaster process to indicate its state in the communi-
     cation process, to change the job  specification  of  a  job
     which  should  be verified and to report messages or errors.
     Below you can find the commands which are understood by  the
     client/qmaster  which will implement version 1.0 of the com-
     munication protocol which was first implemented in Sun  Grid
     Engine 6.2u2:

     error_command := 'ERROR' message ;
          Any time a JSV script  encounters  an  error  it  might
          report  it  to the client/qmaster. If the error happens
          during a job verification the job  which  is  currently
          verified  will  be  rejected.  The JSV binary or script
          will also be restarted before it gets a  new  verifica-
          tion task.

     log_command := 'LOG' log_level ;

     log_level := 'INFO' | 'WARNING' | 'ERROR'
          log_commands can be used whenever the client or qmaster
          expects  input from a JSV instance. This command can be
          used in client JSVs to send  information  to  the  user
          submitting  the  job.  In  client  JSVs  all  messages,
          independent of the log_level will  be  printed  to  the
          stdout  stream  of  the used submit client. If a server
          JSV receives a log_command it  will  add  the  received
          message  to  the  message file respecting the specified
          log_level.  Please  note  that  message  might  contain
          spaces but no new line characters.

     param_command (find definition above)
          By sending param_commands a JSV script can  change  the
          job  specification of the job which should be verified.
          If a JSV instance later on sends a result_command which
          indicates  that  a JSV instance should be accepted with
          correction  then  the  values   provided   with   these
          param_commands will be used to modify the job before it
          is accepted by the Sun Grid Engine system.

     result_command := 'RESULT' result_type [ message ] ;

     result_type := 'ACCEPT' | 'CORRECT' | 'REJECT' | 'REJECT_WAIT' ;
          After the verification of a job is done a JSV script or
          binary has to send  a  result_command  which  indicates
          what should happen with the job.  If the result_type is
          ACCEPTED the job will be accepted as it  was  initially
          submitted  by  the  end  user.  All  param_commands and
          env_commands which might  have  been  sent  before  the
          result_command   are   ignored   in   this  case.   The
          result_type CORRECT indicates that the  job  should  be
          accepted    after    all    modifications    sent   via
          param_commands and env_commands are applied to the job.
          REJECT  and  REJECT_WAIT  cause  the  client or qmaster
          instance to reject the job.

     send_data_command := 'SEND' data_name ;

     data_name := 'ENV';
          If a client/qmaster receives a send_env_command from  a
          JSV  instance before a started_command is sent, then it
          will not only pass job parameters  with  param_commands
          but  also  env_commands  which provide the JSV with the
          information  which  environment  variables   would   be
          exported  to the job environment if the job is accepted
          and started later on.

          The job environment is not passed to JSV  instances  as
          default  because  the  job  environment of the end user
          might contain data which might be interpreted wrong  in
          the  JSV  context  and  might therefore cause errors or
          security issues.

     started_command := 'STARTED' ;
          By sending the started_command a JSV instance indicates
          that   it   is  ready  to  receive  param_commands  and
          env_commands for a new job verification. It  will  only
          receive  env_commands  if  it sends a send_data_command
          before the started_command.

PSEUDO PARAMETERS
     CLIENT
          The corresponding value for the  CLIENT  parameters  is
          either  'qmaster'  or  the name of a submit client like
          'qsub',
           'qsh', 'qrsh', 'qlogin' and so on This parameter value
          can't  be  changed by JSV instances.  It will always be
          sent as part of a job verification.

     CMDARGS
          Number of arguments which will be  passed  to  the  job
          script  or  command  when the job execution is started.
          It will always be sent as part of a  job  verification.
          If  no  arguments should be passed to the job script or
          command it will have the value 0. This parameter can be
          changed  by  JSV  instances. If the value of CMDARGS is
          bigger than the number of available CMDARG&lt;id&gt;  parame-
          ters  then the missing parameters will be automatically
          passed as empty parameters to the job script.

     CMDNAME
          Either the path to the script or the  command  name  in
          case  of  binary  submission. It will always be sent as
          part of a job verification.

     CONTEXT
          Either  'client'  if  the  JSV  which   receives   this
          param_command  was started by a commandline client like
          <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, ... or 'master' if it  was  started  by  the
          <I>sge</I>_<I>qmaster</I> process.  It will always be sent as part of
          a job verification.  Changing the value of this parame-
          ters is not possible within JSV instances.

     GROUP
          Defines Primary group of the user which tries to submit
          the job which should be verified. This parameter cannot
          be changed but is always sent as part of the  verifica-
          tion  process.  The  user  name is passed as parameters
          with the name USER.

     JOB_ID
          Not available in the client context (see CONTEXT). Oth-
          erwise it contains the job number of the job which will
          be submitted to Grid Engine when the verification  pro-
          cess  is  successful.  JOB_ID  is an optional parameter
          which can't be changed by JSV instances.

     USER Username of the user which  tries  to  submit  the  job
          which  should  be  verified.  Cannot  be changed but is
          always sent as part of the  verification  process.  The
          group name  is passed as parameter with the name GROUP

     VERSION
          VERSION will always be sent as part of a job  verifica-
          tion  process and it will always be the first parameter
          which is sent. It will contain a version number of  the
          format &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;. In version 6.2u2 and higher the
          value will be '1.0'. The value of this parameter  can't
          be changed.

EXAMPLE
     Here is an example for the communication of a client with  a
     JSV instance when following job is submitted:

     &gt; qsub -pe p 3 -hard -l a=1,b=5 -soft -l q=all.q $SGE_ROOT/examples/jobs/sleeper.sh

     Data in the first column is sent from the client/qmaster  to
     the  JSV  instance. That data contained in the second column
     is sent from the JSV script to the client/qmaster. New  line
     characters  which  terminate  each line in the communication
     protocol are omitted.

        START
                                SEND ENV
                                STARTED
        PARAM VERSION 1.0
        PARAM CONTEXT client
        PARAM CLIENT qsub
        PARAM USER ernst
        PARAM GROUP staff
        PARAM CMDNAME /sge_root/examples/jobs/sleeper.sh
        PARAM CMDARGS 1
        PARAM CMDARG0 12
        PARAM l_hard a=1,b=5
        PARAM l_soft q=all.q
        PARAM M user@hostname
        PARAM N Sleeper
