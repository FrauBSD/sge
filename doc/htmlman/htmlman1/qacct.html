NAME
     qacct - report and account for Sun Grid Engine usage

SYNOPSIS
     qacct [ -ar [ar_id] ] [ -A Account ] [ -b BeginTime ]  [  -d
     Days ] [ -e EndTime ] [ -g [GroupId|GroupName] ] [ -h [Host-
     Name] ] [ -help ] [  -j  [job_id|job_name|pattern]  ]  [  -l
     attr=val,...  ]  [  -o  [Owner]  ]  [  -pe  [PEname]  ] [ -q
     [wc_queue] ] [ -slots [SlotNumber] ] [ -t task_id_range_list
     ] [ -P [Project] ] [ -D [Department] ] [ -f <I>AcctFileName</I> ]

DESCRIPTION
     The <I>qacct</I>  utility  scans  the  accounting  data  file  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/accounting.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">accounting(5)</A></B>)  and  produces  a  summary of information for
     wall-clock  time,  cpu-time,  and  system   time   for   the
     categories  of hostname, queue-name, group-name, owner-name,
     job-name, job-ID and for the  queues  meeting  the  resource
     requirements  as specified with the -l switch.  Combinations
     of  each  category  are  permitted.  Alternatively,  all  or
     specific jobs can be listed with the -j switch.  For example
     the search criteria could include summarizing  for  a  queue
     and an owner, but not for two queues in the same request.

OPTIONS
     -ar [ar_id]
          The ID of the advance reservation for  which  usage  is
          summarized.   If ar_id is not given, accounting data is
          listed for each advance reservation separately.

     -A Account
          The account for jobs to be summarized.

     -b BeginTime
          The earliest start time for jobs to be  summarized,  in
          the  format  [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]. See also -d option.
          If CC is not specified, a YY of &lt; 70 means 20YY.

     -d Days
          The number of days to summarize  and  print  accounting
          information  on. If used together with the -b BeginTime
          option (see above), jobs started  within  BeginTime  to
          BeginTime + Days are counted. If used together with the
          -e EndTime (see below) option, count starts at  EndTime
          - Days.

     -e EndTime
          The latest start time for jobs to be summarized, in the
          format [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]. See also -d option. If CC
          is not specified, a YY of &lt; 70 means 20YY.

     [-f AcctFileName]
          The accounting file to be used. If omitted, the  system
          default accounting file is processed.

     -g [GroupId|GroupName]
          The numeric system group id or the  group  alphanumeric
          name  of  the job owners to be included in the account-
          ing. If GroupId/GroupName is omitted,  all  groups  are
          accounted.

     -h [HostName]
          The  case-insensitive  name  of  the  host  upon  which
          accounting  information  is  requested.  If the name is
          omitted, totals for each host are listed separately.

     -help
          Display help information for the <I>qacct</I> command.

     -j [job_id|job_name|pattern]
          The name, a expression for matching names, or ID of the
          job  during  execution for which accounting information
          is printed. If neither a name nor an ID  is  given  all
          jobs are enlisted.
          This option changes the  output  format  of  <I>qacct</I>.  If
          activated,  CPU times are no longer accumulated but the
          "raw" accounting information is printed in a  formatted
          form  instead.  See <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/accounting.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">accounting(5)</A></B> for an explanation of
          the displayed information.

     -l attr=val,...
          A resource requirement specification which must be  met
          by  the  queues  in which the jobs being accounted were
          executing. The resource request is very similar to  the
          one described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>.

     -o [Owner]
          The name of the owner of the jobs for which  accounting
          statistics  are  assembled. If the optional Owner argu-
          ment is omitted, a listing of the accounting statistics
          of  all job owners being present in the accounting file
          is produced.

     -pe [PEname]
          The name of the parallel environment for which usage is
          summarized.  If PEname is not given, accounting data is
          listed for each parallel environment separately.

     -q [wc_queue_name]
          A expression for queues for which usage is  summarized.
          All  queue  instances  matching  the expression will be
          listed. If no expression is specified, a cluster  queue
          summary will be given.

     -slots [SlotNumber]
          The number of queue slots for which  usage  is  summar-
          ized.   If  SlotNumber is not given, accounting data is
          listed for each number of queue slots separately.

     -t task_id_range_list
          Only available together with the  -j  option  described
          above.

          The -t switch specifies the array job task  range,  for
          which  accounting information should be printed. Syntax
          and semantics of task_id_range_list  are  identical  to
          that  one  described  under  the  -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>.
          Please see there also for further information on  array
          jobs.

     -P [Project]
          The name of the project for which usage is  summarized.
          If  Project is not given, accounting data is listed for
          each owning project separately.

     -D [Department]
          The name of the department for which usage  is  summar-
          ized.   If  Department is not given, accounting data is
          listed for each owning department separately.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell. To address a Sun Grid Engine cell <I>qacct</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

     SGE_EXECD_PORT If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_execd" instead to define that port.
