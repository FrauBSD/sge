NAME
     qrdel - delete Sun Grid Engine Advance Reservations (AR)

SYNTAX
     qrdel [-f] [-help [-u wc_user_list] wc_ar_list

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qrdel</I> provides a means for a user/operator/manager to delete
     one  or  more  Advance Reservations (AR). A manager/operator
     can delete ARs belonging to any user, while a  regular  user
     can  only  delete his or her own ARs.  If a manager wants to
     delete another user's AR, the manager can specify the AR id.
     By  default,  "qrdel  wc_ar_name"  will  delete only the ARs
     belonging to that user. A manager is able to delete  another
     user's  AR  via  "-u  wc_user_list". Jobs referring to an AR
     tagged for deletion will also be removed. Only if  all  jobs
     referring  to  an  AR  are  removed from the Sun Grid Engine
     database will the AR also be removed.

     <I>Qrdel</I> deletes ARs in the order in which the  AR  identifiers
     are   presented.   Find  additional  information  concerning
     <I>wc</I>_<I>user</I>_<I>list</I> and <I>wc</I>_<I>ar</I>_<I>list</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

OPTIONS
     -f   Force action for AR. The AR and the jobs using  the  AR
          are  deleted  from  the  Sun Grid Engine queuing system
          even if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> controlling the AR  jobs  does
          not   respond   to  the  delete  request  sent  by  the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.
          Users which have neither Sun Grid  Engine  manager  nor
          operator  status  can  only use the -f option for their
          own ARs.

     -help
          Prints a list of all options.

     -u wc_user_list
          Deletes only those ARs which were  submitted  by  users
          specified  in  the list of usernames.  For managers, it
          is possible to use qrdel -u "*" to delete all  ARs  for
          all  users.  If a manager wants to delete a specific AR
          for a user, he has to specify the user and the  AR  id.
          If  no  AR is specified, all ARs belonging to that user
          are deleted.

     wc_ar_list
          A list of AR id's that should be deleted

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell. To address a Sun Grid Engine cell <I>qrdel</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set, specifies the tcp port on  which  the
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  service  map  entry  for  the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead of defining the port.
