NAME
     qmake - distributed parallel make, scheduling  by  Sun  Grid
     Engine.

SYNTAX
     qmake [ options ] -- [ gmake options ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qmake</I> is a parallel, distributed <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/make.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">make(1)</A></B> utility. Scheduling
     of the parallel <I>make</I> tasks is done by Sun Grid Engine. It is
     based on <I>gmake</I> (GNU make), version  3.78.1.  Both  Sun  Grid
     Engine and <I>gmake</I> command line options can be specified. They
     are separated by "--".

     All Sun Grid Engine options valid with  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>  or  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrsh(1)</A></B>
     can  be  specified with <I>qmake</I> - see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/submit.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">submit(1)</A></B> for a descrip-
     tion of all Sun  Grid  Engine  command  line  options.   The
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/make.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">make(1)</A></B> manual page describes the <I>gmake</I> command line syntax.

     The syntax of <I>qmake</I> makefiles corresponds to  <I>gmake</I>  and  is
     described in the "GNU Make Manual".

     A typical qmake call will use the Sun  Grid  Engine  command
     line  options  -cwd  to have a scheduled make started in the
     current working directory on the execution host, -v PATH  if
     the  Sun  Grid  Engine environment is not setup in the users
     .cshrc or .profile shell resource file and request slots  in
     a parallel environment (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_pe(5)</A></B> ).

     If no resource request (Sun Grid Engine command line  option
     -l)  is  specified,  qmake will use the environment variable
     SGE_ARCH to request the same architecture for task execution
     as  has  the submit host.  If SGE_ARCH is set, the architec-
     ture specified in SGE_ARCH will be  requested  by  inserting
     the  option -l arch=$SGE_ARCH into the command line options.
     If SGE_ARCH is not set, the make tasks can  be  executed  on
     any available architecture.  As this is critical for typical
     make (compile) jobs, a warning will be output.

     <I>qmake</I> has two different modes for allocating Sun Grid Engine
     resources for the parallel execution of tasks:

     1. Allocation of resources using a parallel environment.  If
     the -pe option is used on the qmake command line, a parallel
     job is scheduled by Sun Grid Engine.   The  make  rules  are
     executed as tasks within this parallel job.

     2. Dynamic allocation of resources. If no parallel  environ-
     ment  is  requested  when  submitting a qmake job, each make
     rule will generate an individual Sun Grid Engine  qrsh  job.
     All  resource  requests  given to qmake will be inherited by
     the jobs processing the make rules.
     In dynamic allocation mode, additional resource requests for
     individual  rules  can be specified by preceding the rule by
     the definition of an environment variable SGE_RREQ. The rule
     then   takes  the  form  SGE_RREQ="&lt;request&gt;"  &lt;rule&gt;,  e.g.
     SGE_RREQ="-l lic=1" cc -c ...  If such  makefile  rules  are
     executed in a make utility other than qmake, the environment
     variable SGE_RREQ will be set in the environment established
     for the rule's execution - without any effect.

EXAMPLES
          qmake -cwd -v PATH -pe compiling 1-10 --

     will request between 1 and 10 slots in parallel  environment
     "compiling".  If the SGE_ARCH environment variable is set to
     the  machines  architecture,  a  resource  request  will  be
     inserted  into the qmake command line to start the qmake job
     on the same architecture as the submit host. The <I>make</I>  tasks
     will  inherit the complete environment of the calling shell.
     It will execute as many parallel tasks as  slots  have  been
     granted by Sun Grid Engine.

          qmake -l arch=sol-sparc -cwd -v PATH -- -j 4

     will submit each make rule as an individual qrsh job. A max-
     imum  of  4  tasks will be processed in parallel.  The qmake
     job will be started on a machine of architecture  sol-sparc,
     this  resource  request  will  also be inherited by the make
     tasks, i.e. all jobs created for the execution of make tasks
     will request the architecture sol-sparc.

     If the following Makefile is submitted with the  above  com-
     mand  line,  additional  resource  requests will be made for
     individual rules:  For the compile and link rules,  compiler
     licenses   (comp)   and   linker  licenses  (link)  will  be
     requested, in addition to the resource request made for  the
     whole job (-l arch=sol-sparc) on the command line.

          all: test

          clean:
               rm -f test main.o functions.o

          test: main.o functions.o
               SGE_RREQ="-l link=1" ld -o test main.o functions.o

          main.o: main.c
               SGE_RREQ="-l comp=1" cc -c -DALIASPATH=

          functions.o: functions.c
               SGE_RREQ="-l comp=1" cc -c -DALIASPATH=


     The command line
          qmake -cwd -v PATH -l arch=sol-sparc64 -pe make 3 --

     will request 3 parallel <I>make</I> tasks to be executed  on  hosts
     of  architecture  "sol-sparc64". The submit may be done on a
     host of any architecture.

     The shell script

          #!/bin/sh
          qmake -inherit --

     can be submitted by

          qsub -cwd -v PATH -pe make 1-10 [further sge options] &lt;script&gt;

     <I>Qmake</I> will inherit the resources granted for the job submit-
     ted above under parallel environment "make".

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell. To address a Sun Grid Engine cell <I>qmake</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_ARCH       The architecture of the submit host. If  this
                    variable  is  set  in the submission environ-
                    ment, qmake will request the given  architec-
                    ture   for  job  execution  (see  DESCRIPTION
                    above).

KNOWN PROBLEMS
  Slow NFS server
     Very low file server performance may  lead  to  problems  on
     depending files.

     Example: Host a compiles a.c to a.o, host b compiles b.c  to
     b.o,  host  c shall link program c from a.o and b.o. In case
     of very bad NFS performance, host c might not yet see  files
     a.o and b.o.

  Multiple commands in one rule
     If multiple commands are executed in one rule, the  makefile
     has to ensure that they are handled as one command line.

     Example:

          libx.a:
               cd x
               ar ru libx.a x.o

     Building libx.a will fail, if the commands are  executed  in
     parallel  (and  possibly on different hosts). Write the fol-
     lowing instead:

          libx.a:
               cd x ; ar ru libx.a x.o

     or

          libx.a:
               cd x ; \
               ar ru libx.a x.o
