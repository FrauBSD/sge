NAME
     qdel - delete Sun Grid Engine jobs from queues

SYNTAX
     qdel  [  -f  ]  [  -help   ]   [   -u   wc_user_list   ]   [
     wc_job_range_list ] [ -t task_id_range ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qdel</I> provides a means for a user/operator/manager to  delete
     one or more jobs. A manager/operator can delete jobs belong-
     ing to any user, while a regular user can only delete his or
     her  own  jobs.  If a manager wants to delete another user's
     job, the manager can specify the job id. If the  manager  is
     using a job name or pattern, he or she must also specify the
     user's name via "-u wc_user_list". A "qdel wc_job_name" will
     delete  only  the jobs of the calling user by default.  <I>Qdel</I>
     deletes jobs in the order in which their job identifiers are
     presented.    Find    additional    information   concerning
     <I>wc</I>_<I>user</I>_<I>list</I> and <I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>_<I>list</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

OPTIONS
     -f   Force deletion of job(s). The job(s) are  deleted  from
          the  list  of jobs registered at <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> even if
          the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  controlling  the  job(s)  does   not
          respond to the delete request sent by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

          Users which are neither Sun Grid  Engine  managers  nor
          operators  can  only  use  the -f option (for their own
          jobs) if the cluster configuration entry qmaster_params
          contains the flag ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).
          However,   behavior   for   administrative   and   non-
          administrative users differs. Jobs are deleted from the
          Sun  Grid  Engine  database  immediately  in  case   of
          administrators.   Otherwise,   a  regular  deletion  is
          attempted first and a forced cancellation is only  exe-
          cuted if the regular deletion was unsuccessful.

          Additionally regular qdel  requests  can  result  in  a
          forced       deletion       of       a      job      if
          ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL_IF_UNKNOWN    is    set    in    the
          qmaster_params (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>)

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -t   Deletes specified tasks of array job.  It  means  tasks
          created  by qsub -t command. For example after creating
          array    job    by    command    "qsub     -t     1-100
          $SGE_ROOT/examples/sleeper.sh" it is possible to delete
          tasks 5-10 from job array by command  "qdel  job_id  -t
          5-10".   All  other tasks (1-4 and 11-100) will be exe-
          cuted.

     -u wc_user_list
          Deletes only those jobs which were submitted  by  users
          specified in the list of usernames.  For managers it is
          possible to use qdel -u "*" to delete all jobs  of  all
          users. If a manager wants to delete a specific job of a
          user, he has to specify the user and the job. If no job
          is specified all jobs from that user are deleted.

     wc_job_range_list
          A list of jobs, which should be deleted

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell.  To address a Sun Grid Engine cell <I>qdel</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
