NAME
     qhold - hold back Sun Grid Engine jobs from execution

SYNTAX
     qhold [ -h {u|o|s},...  ] [ -help ] [ job/task_id_list ]

     qhold [ -h {u|o|s},...  ] [ -help ] -u user_list

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qhold</I> provides a means for a user/operator/manager to  place
     so  called <I>holds</I> on one or more jobs pending to be scheduled
     for execution.  As long as any type of hold is assigned to a
     job, the job is not eligible for scheduling.

     Holds can be removed with the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrls.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrls(1)</A></B> or the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qalter(1)</A></B>  com-
     mand.

     There are three different types of holds:

     user User holds can be assigned  and  removed  by  managers,
          operators and the owner of the jobs.

     operator
          Operator holds can be assigned and removed by  managers
          and operators.

     system
          System holds can be assigned and  removed  by  managers
          only.

     If no hold type is specified with the -h option (see  below)
     the user hold is assumed by default.

     An alternate way to assign holds to jobs is the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>  or
     the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qalter(1)</A></B> command (see the -<I>h</I> option).

OPTIONS
     -h {u|o|s},...
          Assign a u(ser), o(perator) or s(system) hold or a com-
          bination thereof to one or more jobs.

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -u username,...
          Changes are only made on those jobs which were  submit-
          ted  by  users  specified  in  the  list  of usernames.
          Managers are allowed to use the qhold -u "*" command to
          set a hold for all jobs of all users.

          If a user uses the -u switch, the user may  specify  an
          additional <I>job</I>/<I>task</I>_<I>id</I>_<I>list</I>.

     job/task_id_list
          Specified by the following form:

              <I>job</I>_<I>id</I>[.<I>task</I>_<I>range</I>][,<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>[.<I>task</I>_<I>range</I>],...]

          If present, the <I>task</I>_<I>range</I> restricts the effect of  the
          <I>qhold</I>  operation  to the array job task range specified
          as suffix to the job id (see the -t option  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B>
          for further details on array jobs).

          The task range specifier has the  form  n[-m[:s]].  The
          range  may  be a single number, a  simple range  of the
          form n-m or a range with a step size.

          Instead of <I>job</I>/<I>task</I>_<I>id</I>_<I>list</I> it is possible to  use  the
          keyword  'all' to modify the hold state for all jobs of
          the current user.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell. To address a Sun Grid Engine cell <I>qhold</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
