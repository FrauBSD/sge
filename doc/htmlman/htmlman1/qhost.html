NAME
     qhost - show the status of Sun Grid  Engine  hosts,  queues,
     jobs

SYNTAX
     qhost [ -cb ] [ -F [resource_name,...]  ] [  -help  ]  [  -h
     host_list ] [ -j ] [ -l resource=val,... ] [ -u user,... ] [
     -xml ].

DESCRIPTION
     <I>qhost</I> shows the current status of  the  available  Sun  Grid
     Engine  hosts,  queues  and  the  jobs  associated  with the
     queues. Selection options allow you to get information about
     specific  hosts,  queues, jobs or users.  If multiple selec-
     tions are done a host is only  displayed  if  all  selection
     criteria for a host are met.  Without any options <I>qhost</I> will
     display a list of all hosts without queue  or  job  informa-
     tion.

OPTIONS
     -F [ resource_name,... ]
          <I>qhost</I> will present a detailed listing  of  the  current
          resource  availability  per  host  with  respect to all
          resources (if the option argument is omitted)  or  with
          respect   to   those   resources   contained   in   the
          resource_name list. Please refer to the description  of
          the  Full  Format  in  section OUTPUT FORMATS below for
          further detail.

     -cb  This command line switch can be  used  since  Sun  Grid
          Engine version 6.2u5 in combination with other <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhost.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qhost(1)</A></B>
          command line switches. In that case the output  of  the
          corresponding command will contain information concern-
          ing the added job to core binding feature.

          If this switch is not used then the command behaves  as
          in version 6.2u4 and previous versions.

          If this option is used then two additional columns will
          be  shown  for  each  displayed host in the output. The
          first is named NSOC and represents the number of avail-
          able sockets on that host. The second additional column
          is named NCOR and it represents  the  number  of  cores
          that  are  available  per  socket  on the corresponding
          machine.

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -h host_list
          Prints a list of all hosts contained in host_list.

     -j   Prints all jobs running on the  queues  hosted  by  the
          shown hosts. This switch calls -q implicitly.

     -l resource[=value],...
          Defines the resources to be granted by the hosts  which
          should be included in the host list output. Matching is
          performed on hosts based on non-mutable resource  avai-
          lability  information  only. That means load values are
          always ignored except the so-called static load  values
          (i.e. "arch", "num_proc", "mem_total", "swap_total" and
          "virtual_total") ones. Also consumable  utilization  is
          ignored.   If  there  are multiple -l resource requests
          they will be concatenated by  a  logical  AND:  a  host
          needs to match all resources to be displayed.

     -q   Show information about the queues instances  hosted  by
          the displayed hosts.

     -u user,...
          Display information only on those jobs and queues being
          associated with the users from the given user list.

     -xml This option can be used  with  all  other  options  and
          changes  the output to XML. The used schemas are refer-
          enced in the XML  output.  The  output  is  printed  to
          stdout.

          If the -xml parameter is combined with -cb then the XML
          output will contain additional tags containing informa-
          tion about job to core binding.  You  can  find  schema
          files   with   the   suffix   "_cb"  in  the  directory
          $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/schemas/qhost  that   describe
          that changes.

OUTPUT FORMATS
     Depending on the presence or absence of the -q or -F and  -j
     option three output formats need to be differentiated.  PP

  Default Format (without -q, -F and -j)
     For each host one line is printed. The  output  consists  of
     consisting of

     <B>o</B>  the Hostname

     <B>o</B>  the Architecture.

     <B>o</B>  the  Number of processors.

     <B>o</B>  the Load.

     <B>o</B>  the Total Memory.

     <B>o</B>  the Used Memory.

     <B>o</B>  the Total Swapspace.

     <B>o</B>  the Used Swapspace.

     If the -q option is supplied, each  host  status  line  also
     contains extra lines for every queue hosted by the host con-
     sisting of,

     <B>o</B>  the queue name.

     <B>o</B>  the  queue  type  -  one   of   B(atch),   I(nteractive),
        C(heckpointing),  P(arallel),  T(ransfer) or combinations
        thereof,

     <B>o</B>  the number of reserved, used and available job slots,

     <B>o</B>  the state  of  the  queue  -  one  of  u(nknown)  if  the
        corresponding  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> cannot be contacted, a(larm),
        A(larm),     C(alendar      suspended),      s(uspended),
        S(ubordinate),  d(isabled), D(isabled), E(rror) or combi-
        nations thereof.

     If the state is a(alarm) at least one of the load thresholds
     defined  in the <I>load</I>_<I>thresholds</I> list of the queue configura-
     tion  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>)  is  currently  exceeded,   which
     prevents from scheduling further jobs to that queue.

     As opposed to this, the  state  A(larm)  indicates  that  at
     least  one  of  the  suspend  thresholds  of  the queue (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) is currently exceeded. This  will  result  in
     jobs  running  in  that  queue  being successively suspended
     until no threshold is violated.

     The states s(uspended) and d(isabled)  can  be  assigned  to
     queues  and  released  via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmod(1)</A></B> command. Suspending a
     queue will cause all jobs executing  in  that  queue  to  be
     suspended.

     The states D(isabled) and C(alendar suspended) indicate that
     the  queue  has been disabled or suspended automatically via
     the   calendar   facility   of   Sun   Grid   Engine    (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>),  while the S(ubordinate) state indicates,
     that the queue has been suspend via subordination to another
     queue  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>  for  details). When suspending a
     queue (regardless of the cause) all jobs executing  in  that
     queue are suspended too.

     If an E(rror) state is displayed for a  queue,  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
     on  that  host was unable to locate the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> exe-
     cutable on that host in order to start a job.  Please  check
     the  error  logfile of that <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> for leads on how to
     resolve the problem. Please enable the queue afterwards  via
     the -c option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmod(1)</A></B> command manually.

     If the -F option was used, resource availability information
     is printed following the host status line. For each resource
     (as selected  in  an  option  argument  to  -F  or  for  all
     resources  if the option argument was omitted) a single line
     is displayed with the following format:

     <B>o</B>  a one letter specifier  indicating  whether  the  current
        resource availability value was dominated by either
        `g' - a cluster global,
        `h' - a host total or

     <B>o</B>  a second one letter specifier indicating the  source  for
        the current resource availability value, being one of
        `l' - a load value reported for the resource,
        `L' - a load value for the resource  after  administrator
        defined load scaling has been applied,
        `c' - availability derived from the consumable  resources
        facility (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complexes.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complexes(5)</A></B>),
        `f' - a fixed  availability  definition  derived  from  a
        non-consumable  complex  attribute  or  a  fixed resource
        limit.

     <B>o</B>  after a colon the name of the resource on which  informa-
        tion is displayed.

     <B>o</B>  after an equal sign  the  current  resource  availability
        value.

     The displayed availability values and the sources from which
     they  derive  are  always the minimum values of all possible
     combinations.  Hence,  for  example,  a  line  of  the  form
     "qf:h_vmem=4G"  indicates  that a queue currently has a max-
     imum availability in virtual memory  of  4  Gigabyte,  where
     this  value  is  a fixed value (e.g. a resource limit in the
     queue configuration) and it is  queue  dominated,  i.e.  the
     host  in  total  may have more virtual memory available than
     this, but the queue doesn't allow  for  more.  Contrarily  a
     line  "hl:h_vmem=4G" would also indicate an upper bound of 4
     Gigabyte virtual memory availability, but the limit would be
     derived  from  a load value currently reported for the host.
     So while the queue might allow for jobs with higher  virtual
     memory requirements, the host on which this particular queue
     resides currently only has 4 Gigabyte available.

     After the queue status line (in case of -j) a single line is
     printed  for  each job running currently in this queue. Each
     job status line contains

     <B>o</B>  the job ID,

     <B>o</B>  the job name,

     <B>o</B>  the job owner name,

     <B>o</B>  the status of the job - one of t(ransfering),  r(unning),
        R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended) or T(hreshold) (see
        the Reduced Format section for detailed information),

     <B>o</B>  the start date and time and the function of the job (MAS-
        TER or SLAVE - only meaningful in case of a parallel job)
        and

     <B>o</B>  the priority of the jobs.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell. To address a Sun Grid Engine cell <I>qhost</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

FILES
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>act</I>_<I>qmaster</I>
