NAME
     qmon - X-Windows OSF/Motif graphical  user's  interface  for
     Sun Grid Engine

SYNTAX
     qmon [options]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qmon</I> allows administrators and users to manipulate  the  Sun
     Grid  Engine system from an X-Window environment.  <I>Qmon</I> pro-
     vides various dialogues linked together  in  multiple  ways.
     For  each  task  the  user  wishes  to accomplish via <I>qmon</I> a
     corresponding dialogue is provided. There are multiple  ways
     to address the proper dialogue for a certain task:

     <B>o</B>  The <I>qmon</I> main window that comes up first on start-up con-
        tains  icon buttons for all major administrative and user
        tasks. A functionality tooltip is displayed when pointing
        at the different icons.

     <B>o</B>  A Task pulldown menu button appears in the <I>qmon</I> main win-
        dow  menu  bar.  Clicking on it opens a list of available
        tasks. Selecting one  of  them  opens  the  corresponding
        dialogue.

     <B>o</B>  The Task pulldown menu also contains the key accelerators
        which  can  be used to invoke the task dialogues directly
        from  the  main  window  by  pressing  a  certain  button
        sequence on the keyboard.

     <B>o</B>  While navigating  through  a  certain  dialogue  and  its
        dialogue  subhierarchy,  links  to  other dialogues occur
        whenever a connection between both dialogues is  obvious.
        Pushing  the buttons that identify the links opens up the
        other dialogues.

OPTIONS
     The supported options are the standard X Toolkit options  as
     described  in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/X.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">X(1)</A></B>  section Options. Furthermore, <I>qmon</I> sup-
     ports:

     -cmap
          Installs a private color map for <I>qmon</I>.  This  is  some-
          times  useful  if other applications have already allo-
          cated lots of colors and  if  <I>qmon</I>,  therefore,  prints
          corresponding error messages. Note, however, that using
          a private color map will result in color  map  switches
          whenever you enter or leave <I>qmon</I> windows.

     -fontFamily {big|medium|small}
          Notifies <I>qmon</I> to use different sized font families  for
          different resolution sizes.

     -help
          Displays usage information.

     -nologo
          Startup without logo.

DIALOGUES
  Job Control
     The Job Control dialogue  provides  a  folder  of  tabulated
     lists  of  the  still pending jobs, already running jobs and
     recently finished jobs. The  dialogue  allows  for  detailed
     information  on  the  jobs  as  well as for the deletion and
     suspension of jobs being selected. In addition the job  con-
     trol  dialogue  offers links to the Submit dialogue in order
     to submit new jobs or to change attributes of  pending  jobs
     (Qalter  button).  The shown displayed fields in the tabular
     display and the jobs displayed can be customized by pressing
     the Customize button. This customization can be saved to the
     ~/.<I>qmon</I>_<I>preferences</I> file and is used on  following  startups
     for the initial configuration of the Job Control dialogue.


  Queue Control
     The Queue Control dialogue with its  sub-dialogue  hierarchy
     enables  the  user  to  control  the  status of the Sun Grid
     Engine queues being actually configured in  the  system  and
     allows  the  administrator to add new queues or to modify or
     delete already existing ones.  The  Queue  Control  dialogue
     shows a tabbed view of Cluster Queues or their corresponding
     Queue Instances in a tabular way.

     By pushing the Add, Clone or Modify button,  a  sub-dialogue
     for  configuring  Sun  Grid Engine queues is opened. A queue
     needs to be selected to use the clone and modify  operation.
     The  configuration sub-dialogue allows for definition of the
     queue and its attributes.   The  configuration  sub-dialogue
     contains  in  the upper section the queue name and a list of
     hosts or hostgroups for which this queue contains the confi-
     guration.   The  lower  section  contains a list of hosts or
     hostgroups at the left, where  the  default  attributes  are
     shown  when  the  "@/"  entry is highlighted.  These default
     attributes can be overruled on a hostgroup or host basis  by
     enabling  attributes  and  changing  their values after this
     hostgroup or host entry has been added  in  the  "Attributes
     for Host/Hostgroup" listbox. The queue configuration parame-
     ters  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>)  are  subdivided   in   different
     categories (General Configuration, Execution Methods, Check-
     pointing, Load/Suspend Thresholds, Limits,  Complexes,  User
     Access,  Project  Access,  Subordinate Queues, Owners) which
     are selectable by the tab widget area presented in the lower
     region of the queue configuration sub-dialogue. The adminis-
     trator  may  select  previously  configured  settings   from
     already  existing  queues  (Clone button). By pushing the Ok
     button, the definitions are registered with  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.
     The  Queue  Control  dialogue can be customized in a similar
     way as the Job Control dialogue. The settings  applied  here
     are also saved in ~/.<I>qmon</I>_<I>preferences</I>.

  Submit
     The Job Submission dialogue serves for submitting batch  and
     interactive  jobs  and  is also invoked when changing attri-
     butes  of  pending  jobs  from  the  Job  Control   dialogue
     explained above (Qalter button). To toggle between batch and
     interactive jobs please use the Batch/Interactive button  at
     the  top  of  the button column on the right side of the Job
     Submission screen.

     The  dialogue  consists  of  a  folder  containing  two  job
     preparation dialogue pages. The most frequently used parame-
     ters in the course of a job submission are  offered  on  the
     General  page.  A  job  script  has to be defined, all other
     fields are optional. If the job demands for specification of
     advanced  requirements,  the  Advanced  tab  can  be used to
     switch to an enhanced parameter display.

     If resource requirements are  mandatory  for  the  job,  the
     Request  Resources  icon button has to be used to pop up the
     Requested Resources sub-dialogue. This  sub-dialogue  allows
     for  selection  of the required resources of the job and for
     definition of the quantities in which this resources are  to
     be  provided.  The  Available  Resources  are constituted by
     those complex attributes  being  declared  <I>requestable</I>  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>  for  details). Resource requirements can be made
     Hard, i.e. they must be met before a job can be started in a
     queue,  or  Soft,  i.e.  they are granted on an as available
     basis.

     Closing the Requested Resources sub-dialogue with  the  done
     button  books the specified requirement for the job. Pushing
     the Submit button on the top level Submit  dialogue  submits
     the job.

  Complex Config
     The Complex Config allows the administrator to add new  com-
     plex  attributes  or  to modify or delete existing ones (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>).  The complex configuration dialogue provides  a
     tabulated list of the complex attribute entries and an input
     region for the declaration of new or modified  entries.  The
     Add  button updates the tabulated list with a new attribute.
     The Modify button changes a highlighted existing entry.  The
     Delete  button removes the highlighted attributes.  The Load
     and Save buttons allow saving or reloading the whole  attri-
     bute  list  to  or  from  file.  The Ok button registers the
     additional   or    modified    complex    attributes    with
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  Host Config
     Four types of host related lists can be maintained  via  the
     Host Config dialogue:

          Administration Hosts
          Submit Hosts
          Host Groups
          Execution Hosts

     The host list to be manipulated is selected via clicking  at
     one  of  the  tabs named correspondingly. The first two host
     lists only provide for adding or deleting  entries,  thereby
     allowing  administrative  or submit permission for the hosts
     on the lists, or denying  it  otherwise  respectively.   The
     host group list allows the manipulation of host groups. Host
     groups can reference either other host groups or hosts.  The
     execution  host list entries in addition provide the ability
     to define scaling factors for the load  sensors,  consumable
     complex  attributes  and  access attributes (access, xaccess
     and projects, xprojects) as described in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>.   CPU,
     memory and I/O usage reported for running jobs can be scaled
     in addition and the relative performance of a  host  can  be
     define    with   the   Resource   Capability   Factor   (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">host_conf(5)</A></B>).

  Cluster Config
     This dialogue maintains the cluster global configuration  as
     well  as  host specific derivatives (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).  When
     opened, the dialogue displays a selection list for all hosts
     which  have a configuration assigned. The special name "glo-
     bal" refers to the cluster global configuration. By  pushing
     the Add/Modify button a sub-dialogue is opened, which allows
     for modification of  the  cluster  configuration.  For  host
     specific  configurations  the  'global' host specific confi-
     guration fields are set insensitive  and  only  the  allowed
     parameters can be manipulated.

  Scheduler Config
     The Scheduler Configuration dialogue provides the  means  to
     change  the behavior of the Sun Grid Engine scheduler thread
     part of <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> process.   The  dialogue  contains  a
     representation for all scheduler configuration parameters as
     described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B>.  It is  subdivided  in  the  two
     sections  General  Parameters and Load Adjustments which can
     be selected via  the  corresponding  tabs.   The  Ok  button
     registers any changes with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  Calendar Config
     The Calendar Config allows  the  administrator  to  add  new
     calendars   or  to  modify  or  delete  existing  ones  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>).  The dialogue offers a selection list for
     the existing calendars and displays the configuration of the
     one being  selected.  By  pushing  the  Delete  button,  the
     selected calendar is deleted from the configuration. Pushing
     the Add/Modify button will  open  a  calendar  configuration
     dialogue, which allows to create new calendars or which pro-
     vides the means to change the existing ones. The  Ok  button
     registers   the   additional   or   modified  calendar  with
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  User Config
     User permissions are controlled via the User  Config  dialo-
     gue.   The  tab  widget  in the left section of the dialogue
     allows for selecting between

          Configuration of Manager accounts.
          Configuration of Operator accounts.
          Definition of Usersets.
          Definition of User accounts.

     Those user accounts added to the list of manager or operator
     accounts  are  given permission to act as managers or opera-
     tors respectively when accessing Sun Grid Engine under their
     own account.

     The userset lists are used together with the user_lists  and
     xuser_lists  host,  queue, project and cluster configuration
     parameters (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">project(5)</A></B>  and  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_conf(5)</A></B>)
     to  control  access  of users to hosts, queues, projects and
     the entire cluster.  A userset is just a collection of  user
     names  and  UNIX  group names. Group names are identified by
     prefixing them with a "@" sign. The already defined usersets
     are  displayed in a selection list. These lists can be modi-
     fied and new lists can be created using the Userset  defini-
     tion dialogue.

     Usersets can be used as Access  List  and/or  as  Department
     required  for  the  so called Functional Policy and Override
     Policy (see Ticket Config below).

     User names can be added to the system as entries to the  Sun
     Grid  Engine  user  database (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B>), This can be done
     with the User sub-dialogue.

     The Tickets button in the button list on the right  side  of
     the dialogue opens the Ticket Config dialogue (see below).

  PE Config
     Parallel environment (PE) interfaces can be configured  with
     this  dialogue.  PE interfaces are necessary to describe the
     way how parallel programming environments like PVM (Parallel
     Virtual  Machine), MPI (Message Passing Interface) or shared
     memory parallel systems are to be instantiated and to impose
     access  restrictions  onto  the  PEs.  When  the dialogue is
     opened a list of the already  configured  PEs  is  displayed
     together  with  the current configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_pe(5)</A></B>) of
     the selected PE interface.  To add new PE interfaces  or  to
     modify  existing  ones, an Add and a Modify button is avail-
     able which opens a PE interface configuration  sub-dialogue.
     After  applying  the  changes and quitting this sub-dialogue
     with the OK button, the new  or  modified  PE  interface  is
     registered with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  Checkpoint Config
     Checkpointing environment interfaces can be configured  with
     this  dialogue.  Checkpointing environments are necessary to
     describe the attributes which  the  different  checkpointing
     methods  and  their  derivatives on various operating system
     platforms supported by Sun Grid Engine have. When the dialo-
     gue is opened a list of the already configured checkpointing
     environments is displayed together with the  current  confi-
     guration  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">checkpoint(5)</A></B>) of the selected checkpointing
     environment. To add  new  checkpointing  environment  or  to
     modify  existing  ones, an Add and a Modify button is avail-
     able which opens a checkpointing  environment  configuration
     sub-dialogue.  After  applying the changes and quitting this
     sub-dialogue with the OK button, the new or modified  check-
     pointing environment is registered with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  Ticket Conf
     This dialogue offers an  overview  and  editing  screen  for
     allocating  tickets to the share-based, functional and over-
     ride scheduling policies.

     The Deadline Job button opens the User  Conf  dialogue  box.
     Please  change  to  the  Userset sub-dialogue and select the
     userset named "deadlineusers".  Only users of  this  userset
     may submit deadline jobs.

     The Share Tree Policy button opens the dialogue for creating
     and   editing   the   Sun   Grid   Engine  share  tree  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/share_tree.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">share_tree(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/schedd_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">schedd_conf(5)</A></B> for a  description  of  the
     configuration parameters).

     The Functional Policy button opens the dialogue for creating
     and  editing  the  allocation  of the functional shares (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sched_conf(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">project(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B> and
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B>  for  a  description of the different types of func-
     tional shares and the configurable weighting parameters).

     The Override Policy button opens the dialogue  for  creating
     and   editing   the  allocation  of  override  tickets  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">project(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B> for  a
     description of the different types of override tickets).

  Project Conf
     This button opens a dialog for creating projects.
     The dialogue offers a selection list for the  existing  pro-
     jects  and  displays  the  configuration  of  the  one being
     selected. By pushing the Delete button, the selected project
     is  deleted  from  the configuration. Pushing the Add/Modify
     button will open a  project  configuration  dialogue,  which
     allows to create new projects or which provides the means to
     change the existing ones. Project configuration  in  essence
     means  giving  or  denying  access to a project for usersets
     (see User Conf above as well as <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">project(5)</A></B>).  The Ok  button
     registers   the   additional   or   modified   project  with
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  Browser
     The Object Browser dialogue's purpose is manifold: First  of
     all,  Sun Grid Engine and <I>qmon</I> messages such as notification
     of error or success concerning a previously taken action can
     be  displayed  in  the  dialogue's  output window.  Also the
     standard output and the standard error output of <I>qmon</I> can be
     diverted to the Object Browser output window.

     Additionally the Object Browser can be used to display  con-
     tinuous  information  about  Sun  Grid Engine objects as the
     mouse pointer moves over their representation  as  icons  or
     table  entries  in other <I>qmon</I> dialogues. Currently, only the
     display of the configuration of two Sun Grid Engine  objects
     in two separate dialogues is supported:

     <B>o</B>  Queue configurations are displayed as soon as  the  mouse
        pointer  enters  a queue icon in the top level Queue Con-
        trol dialogue (see above). This facility is activated  by
        pushing the Queue button in the Object Browser dialogue.

     <B>o</B>  Detailed job information is printed as soon as  the  user
        moves  the  mouse  pointer over a line in the Job Control
        dialogue (see above) being assigned to a running or pend-
        ing job.

     <B>o</B>  Additionally job scheduling information is  displayed  in
        the browser if the Why ? button in the Job Control dialo-
        gue is pressed. In this  case  the  Browser  dialogue  is
        opened  implicitly and any scheduling related information
        is displayed.

  Exit
     The Exit icon button is not linked with a dialogue. Its sole
     purpose  is  to  close all active <I>qmon</I> dialogues and to exit
     the application.

RESOURCES
     The available resources, their meaning and the syntax to  be
     followed  in  order  to  modify  them  are  described in the
     default <I>qmon</I> resource file (see the section Files below  for
     the location of the resource file).

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell.  To address a Sun Grid Engine cell <I>qmon</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

RESTRICTIONS
     If the line to be entered in an  editing  window  is  longer
     than  the  width  of the window, then the text just runs off
     the end of the window.

FILES
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/<I>qmon</I>/<I>Qmon</I>           <I>Qmon</I> sample resources file
