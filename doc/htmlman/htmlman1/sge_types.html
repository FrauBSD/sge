NAME
     sge_types - Sun Grid Engine type descriptions

DESCRIPTION
     The Sun Grid Engine user interface consists of several  pro-
     grams and files. Some command-line switches and several file
     attributes  are  types.  The  syntax  for  these  types   is
     explained in this page.

OBJECT TYPES
     These types are used for defining Sun Grid Engine configura-
     tion:

  calendar_name
     A calendar name is the name of a Sun  Grid  Engine  calendar
     described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>.

     <I>calendar</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  ckpt_name
     A "ckpt_name" is the name of a Sun Grid Engine checkpointing
     interface described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">checkpoint(5)</A></B>.

     <I>ckpt</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  complex_name
     A complex name is the name of a  Sun  Grid  Engine  resource
     attribute described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">complex(5)</A></B>.

     <I>complex</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  host_identifier
     A host identifier can be either a host name or a host  group
     name.

     <I>host</I>_<I>identifier</I> := <I>host</I>_<I>name</I> | <I>hostgroup</I>_<I>name</I>

  hostgroup_name
     A host group name is the name of  a  Sun  Grid  Engine  host
     group  described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/hostgroup.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">hostgroup(5)</A></B>.  Note, to allow host group
     names easily be differed from host names  a  "@"  prefix  is
     used.

     <I>hostgroup</I>_<I>name</I> := @<I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  host_name
     A host name is the official name of a host node. Host  names
     with a domain specification such as "gridmaster.sun.com" are
     called fully-qualified host names, whereas host  names  like
     "gridmaster"  are  called  short host names. Note, there are
     the install time parameters default_domain  and  ignore_fqdn
     (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/bootstrap.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">bootstrap(5)</A></B>)  which  affect how Sun Grid Engine deals
     with host names in general.

  jsv_url
     The jsv_url has following format:

     <I>jsv</I>_<I>url</I> := <I>jsv</I>_<I>client</I>_<I>url</I> | <I>jsv</I>_<I>server</I>_<I>url</I>

     <I>jsv</I>_<I>server</I>_<I>url</I> := [ <I>type</I> ':' ] [ <I>user</I> '@' ] <I>path</I>

     <I>jsv</I>_<I>client</I>_<I>url</I> := [ <I>type</I> ':' ] <I>path</I>

     <I>type</I> := 'script'

     In the moment only the <I>type</I> script is  allowed.  This  means
     that  <I>path</I>  is  either  the  path to a script or to a binary
     application which will be used to instantiate a JSV process.
     The  <I>type</I>  is optional till other <I>types</I> are supported by Sun
     Grid Engine.

     Specifying a <I>user</I> is only allowed for server  JSV's.  Client
     JSV's  will  automatically  be  started  as  submit user and
     server JSV's as admin user if not other specified.

     The <I>path</I> has always to be the absolute path to a  binary  or
     application.

  memory_specifier
     Memory specifiers are positive decimal, hexadecimal or octal
     integer  constants  which  may  be  followed by a multiplier
     letter. Valid multiplier letters are k, K, m, M,  g  and  G,
     where  k  means  multiply  the  value by 1000, K multiply by
     1024, m multiply by 1000*1000, M multiply  by  1024*1024,  g
     multiply by 1000*1000*1000 and G multiply by 1024*1024*1024.
     If no multiplier is present, the value is  just  counted  in
     bytes.

  pe_name
     A "pe_name" is the  name  of  a  Sun  Grid  Engine  parallel
     environment described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_pe(5)</A></B>.

     <I>pe</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  project_name
     A project name is the name of  a  Sun  Grid  Engine  project
     described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">project(5)</A></B>.

     <I>project</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  queue_name
     A queue name  is  the  name  of  a  Sun  Grid  Engine  queue
     described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.

     <I>queue</I>_<I>name</I>  := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  time_specifier
     A time specifier either consists of a positive decimal, hex-
     adecimal  or octal integer constant, in which case the value
     is interpreted to be in seconds, or is built  by  3  decimal
     integer  numbers  separated  by  colon signs where the first
     number counts the hours, the  second  the  minutes  and  the
     third  the seconds. If a number would be zero it can be left
     out but the separating colon must remain (e.g. 1:0:1 =  1::1
     means 1 hours and 1 second).

  user_name
     A user name can be the name of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/login.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">login(1)</A></B> user or of the Sun
     Grid Engine user object described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">user(5)</A></B>.

     <I>user</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  userset_name
     A user set name is the name of an  Sun  Grid  Engine  access
     list or department described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">access_list(5)</A></B>.

     <I>userset</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  object_name
     An object name is a sequence of up to 512 ASCII string char-
     acters  except  "\n",  "\t",  "\r", " ", "/", ":", "'", "\",
     "[", "]", "{", "}", "|", "(", ")", "@", "%", ","  or  the  "
     character itself.

MATCHING TYPES
     These types are used for matching Sun Grid Engine configura-
     tion:

  expression
     A wildcard expression is a regular boolean  expression  that
     consists  of  one  or more <I>pattern</I>s joined by boolean opera-
     tors. When a wildcard  expression  is  used,  the  following
     definition applies:

     expression= ["!"] ["("] valExp [")"] [ AND_OR expression ]*
     valExp  = pattern | expression
     AND_OR  = "&amp;" | "|"

     where:

     "!"       not operator -- negate the following pattern or expression
     "&amp;"       and operator -- logically and with the following expression
     "|"       or operator -- logically or with the following expression
     "("       open bracket -- begin an inner expression.
     ")"       close bracket -- end an inner expression.
     "pattern" see the <I>pattern</I> definition that's follow
     The expression itself should be put inside quotes  ('"')  to
     ensure that clients receive the complete expression.

     e.g.
          "(lx*|sol*)&amp;*64*" any string beginning with either "lx" or
                            "sol" and containing "64"
          "rh_3*&amp;!rh_3.1"   any string beginning with "rh_3", except
                            "rh_3.1"

  pattern
     When patterns are used the following definitions apply:

     "*"     matches any character and any number of characters
             (between 0 and inv).
     "?"     matches any character. It cannot be no character
     "."     is the character ".". It has no other meaning
     "\"     escape character. "\\" = "\", "\*" = "*", "\?" = "?"
     "[...]" specifies an array or a range of allowed
             characters for one character at a specific position.
             Character ranges may be specified using the a-z notation.
             The caret symbol (^) is not interpreted as a logical
             not; it is interpreted literally.

     For more details please see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/fnmatch.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">fnmatch(5)</A></B>


     The pattern itself should be  put  inside  quotes  ('"')  to
     ensure that clients receive the complete pattern.

  range
     The task range specifier has the form

     n[-m[:s]][,n[-m[:s]], ...] or n[-m[:s]][ n[-m[:s]] ...]

     and thus consists of a comma  or  blank  separated  list  of
     range  specifiers  n[-m[:s]]. The ranges are concatenated to
     the complete task id range.  Each  range  may  be  a  single
     number,  a  simple  range  of the form n-m or a range with a
     step size.

  wc_ar
     The wildcard advance reservation  (AR)  specification  is  a
     placeholder for AR ids, AR names including AR name patterns.
     An AR id always references one AR, while the name  and  pat-
     tern might reference multiple ARs.

     wc_ar := ar_id | ar_name | pattern

  wc_ar_list
     The wildcard advance  reservation  (AR)  list  specification
     allows to reference multiple ARs with one command.
     wc_ar_list := wc_ar [ , wc_ar , ...]

  wc_host
     A  wildcard  host  specification  (<I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>)  is  a  wildcard
     expression  which  might match one or more hosts used in the
     cluster.  The first character of that  string  never  begins
     with  an  at-character  ('@'), even if the expression begins
     with a wildcard character.

     e.g.
          *            all hosts
          a*           all host beginning with an 'a'

  wc_hostgroup
     A wildcard hostgroup specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>) is a wild-
     card  expression  which  might match one or more hostgroups.
     The first character of that string is always an at-character
     ('@').

     More information concerning hostgroups can be found in <I>host-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/group.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">group(5)</A></B>

     e.g.
          @*           all hostgroups in the cluster
          @solaris     the @solaris hostgroup

  wc_job
     The wildcard job specification is a placeholder for job ids,
     job  names  including  job  name  patterns.  A job id always
     references one job, while the name and pattern might  refer-
     ence multiple jobs.

     wc_job := job-id | job-name | pattern

  wc_job_range
     The wildcard job range  specification  allows  to  reference
     specific  array  tasks  for one or multiple jobs. The job is
     referenced via wc_job and in addition gets a range specifier
     for the array tasks.

     wc_job_range := wc_job [ -t range]

  wc_job_list
     The wildcard job list specification allows to reference mul-
     tiple jobs with one command.

     wc_job_list := wc_job [ , wc_job , ...]

  wc_job_range_list
     The wildcard job range list (<I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>_<I>range</I>_<I>list</I>) is specified
     by one of the following forms:

         <I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>[ -<I>t</I> <I>range</I>][{, }<I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>[ -<I>t</I> <I>range</I>]{, }...]

     If present, the <I>task</I>_<I>range</I> restricts the effect of the  <I>qmod</I>
     operation to the array job task range specified as suffix to
     the job id (see the -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qsub(1)</A></B> for further details
     on array jobs).

  wc_qdomain
     <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> "@" <I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>

     A   wildcard   expression   queue    domain    specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I>) starts with a wildcard expression cluster queue
     name (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>) followed by an at-character '@' and a wild-
     card expression hostgroup specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>).

     <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> are used to address a group of  queue  instances.
     All  queue  instances  residing  on a hosts which is part of
     matching hostgroups will be  addressed.  Please  note,  that
     <I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I> always begins with an at-character.

     e.g.
          *@@*         all queue instances whose underlying
                       host is part of at least one hostgroup
          a*@@e*       all queue instances begins with a whose underlying
                       host is part of at least one hostgroup begin with e
          *@@solaris   all queue instances on hosts part of
                       the @solaris hostgroup

  wc_cqueue
     A   wildcard   expression   cluster   queue    specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>)  is  a wildcard expression which might match one
     or more cluster queues used in  the  cluster.   That  string
     never contains an at-character ('@'), even if the expression
     begins with a wildcard character.

     e.g.
          *            all cluster queues
          a*           all cluster queues beginning with an 'a'
          a*&amp;!adam     all cluster queues beginning with an 'a',but not adam

  wc_qinstance
     <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> "@" <I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>

     A   wildcard   expression   queue   instance   specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>)  starts  with  a  wildcard expression cluster
     queue name (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>) followed by an at-character '@' and a
     wildcard expression hostname (<I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>).

     <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I> expressions are used  to  address  a  group  of
     queue  instances whose underlying hostname matches the given
     expression.  Please note that the first character of <I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>
     does never match the at-character '@'.
     e.g.
          *@*          all queue instances in the cluster
          *@b*         all queue instances whose
                       hostname begins with a 'b'
          *@b*|c*      all queue instances whose
                       hostname begins with a 'b' or 'c'

  wc_queue
     <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> | <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> | <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>

     A wildcard queue expression (<I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>)  might  either  be  a
     wildcard  expression cluster queue specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>)
     or  a  wildcard  expression   queue   domain   specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I>) or a wildcard expression queue instance specif-
     ication (<I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>).

     e.g.
          big_*1           cluster queues which begin with
                           "big_" and end with "1"
          big_*&amp;!*1        cluster queues which begin with
                           "big_" ,but does not end with "1"
          *@fangorn        all qinstances residing on host
                           fangorn

  wc_queue_list
     <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>_<I>list</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> ["," <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> "," ...]

     Comma separated list of wc_queue elements.

     e.g.
          big, medium_*@@sol*, *@fangorn.sun.com

  wc_user
     A wildcard user name pattern is either a wildcard user  name
     specification or a full user name.

     wc_user := user_name | pattern

  wc_user_list
     A list of user names.

     wc_user_list := wc_user [ , wc_user , ...]

  wc_project
     A wildcard project name pattern is either a wildcard project
     name specification or a full project name.

     wc_project := project | pattern

  wc_pe_name
     A wildcard parallel environment name  pattern  is  either  a
     wildcard pe name specification or a full pe name.
     wc_pe_name := pe_name | pattern

  parallel_env n[-[m]]|[-]m,...
     Parallel programming environment (PE) to select for  an  AR.
     The range descriptor behind the PE name specifies the number
     of parallel processes to be run. Sun Grid Engine will  allo-
     cate  the  appropriate resources as available. The <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_pe(5)</A></B>
     manual page contains information about the definition of PEs
     and about how to obtain a list of currently valid PEs.

     You can specify a PE name which uses the wildcard character,
     "*".   Thus  the  request  "pvm*"  will  match  any parallel
     environment with a name starting with the string  "pvm".  In
     the case of multiple parallel environments whose names match
     the name string, the  parallel  environment  with  the  most
     available slots is chosen.

     The range specification is a list of  range  expressions  of
     the  form  "n-m",  where  n  and  m  are  positive, non-zero
     integers.  The form "n" is equivalent to  "n-n".   The  form
     "-m" is equivalent to "1-m".  The form "n-" is equivalent to
     "n-infinity".  The range specification is processed as  fol-
     lows:  The  largest  number  of  queues requested is checked
     first. If enough queues meeting the specified attribute list
     are  available,  all  are reserved. If not, the next smaller
     number of queues is checked, and so forth.

  date_time
     The date_time value must conform to  [[CC]]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS],
     where:

     e.g.
          CC           denotes the century in 2 digits.
          YY           denotes the year in 2 digits.
          MM           denotes the month in 2 digits.
          DD           denotes the day in 2 digits.
          hh           denotes the hour in 2 digits.
          mm           denotes the minute in 2 digits.
          ss           denotes the seconds in 2 digits (default 00).

  time
     The time value must conform to hh:mm:ss, or seconds where:

     e.g.
          hh denotes the hour in 2 digits.
          mm denotes the minute in 2 digits.
          ss denotes the seconds in 2 digits (default 00).
          seconds  is a number of seconds (is used for duration values)

          If any of the optional date  fields  are  omitted,  the
          corresponding  value of the current date is assumed. If
          CC is not specified, a YY of &lt; 70 means 20YY.
          Use of this option may cause unexpected results if  the
          clocks of the hosts in the Sun Grid Engine pool are out
          of sync. Also, the proper behavior of this option  very
          much  depends on the correct setting of the appropriate
          timezone, e.g. in  the  TZ  environment  variable  (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/date.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">date(1)</A></B>  for details), when the Sun Grid Engine daemons
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_execd(8)</A></B> are invoked.

  name
     The name may be any arbitrary alphanumeric ASCII string, but
     may  not contain  "\n", "\t", "\r", "/", ":", "@", "\", "*",
     or "?".
