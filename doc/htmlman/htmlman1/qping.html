NAME
     qping - check application status of Sun Grid Engine daemons.

SYNTAX
     qping [-help] [-noalias] [-ssl|-tcp] [ [ [-i &lt;interval&gt;]  [-
     info]  [-f]  ]  |  [  [-dump_tag  tag  [param]  ] [-dump] [-
     nonewline] ] ] &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt; &lt;name&gt; &lt;id&gt;

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qping</I> is used to validate the runtime status of a  Sun  Grid
     Engine service daemon. The current Sun Grid Engine implemen-
     tation allows one to query the SGE_QMASTER  daemon  and  any
     running  SGE_EXECD daemon. The qping command is used to send
     a SIM (Status Information Message) to the  destination  dae-
     mon.  The  communication  layer of the specified daemon will
     respond with a SIRM (Status  Information  Response  Message)
     which  contains  status information about the consulted dae-
     mon.

     The qping -dump and -dump_tag options allowing  an  adminis-
     trator  to observe the communication protocol data flow of a
     Sun Grid Engine service daemon. The qping -dump  instruction
     must be started with root account and on the same host where
     the observed daemon is running.

OPTIONS
  -f
     Show full status information on each ping interval.

     <I>First</I> <I>output</I> <I>Line</I>:  The first output line shows the date and
     time of the request.

     <I>SIRM</I> <I>version</I>:  Internal version number of the  SIRM  (Status
     Information Response Message)

     <I>SIRM</I> <I>message</I> <I>id</I>:  Current message id for this connection

     <I>start</I> <I>time</I>:  Start time of daemon. The format is as follows:

     MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS (seconds since 01.01.1970)

     <I>run</I> <I>time</I> [<I>s</I>]:  Run time in seconds since start time

     <I>messages</I> <I>in</I> <I>read</I> <I>buffer</I>:  Nr. of buffered messages  in  com-
     munication  buffer. The messages are buffered for the appli-
     cation (daemon). When this number grows too large the daemon
     is not able to handle all messages sent to it.

     <I>messages</I> <I>in</I> <I>write</I> <I>buffer</I>:  Nr. of buffered messages  in  the
     communication  write  buffer. The messages are sent from the
     application (daemon) to the connected clients, but the  com-
     munication  layer  wasn't  able to send the messages yet. If
     this number grows too large, the communication  layer  isn't
     able  to send them as fast as the application (daemon) wants
     the messages to be sent.

     <I>nr</I>. <I>of</I> <I>connected</I> <I>clients</I>:  This is the number of actual con-
     nected clients to this daemon. This also implies the current
     qping connection.

     <I>status</I>:  The status value of the daemon. This value  depends
     on the application which reply to the qping request.  If the
     application does not provide any information the  status  is
     99999.   Here are the possible status information values for
     the Sun Grid Engine daemons:

        qmaster:

           <I>0</I> There is no unusual timing situation.

           <I>1</I> One or more threads  has  reached  warning  timeout.
           This  may  happen  when  at  least one thread does not
           increment his time stamp for a not usual long time.  A
           possible  reason  for this is a high workload for this
           thread.

           <I>2</I> One or more threads has reached error timeout.  This
           may  happen  when  at  least one thread has not incre-
           mented his time stamp for longer than 10 minutes.

           <I>3</I> The time measurement is not initialized.

        execd:

           <I>0</I> There is no unusual timing situation.

           <I>1</I> Dispatcher has reached  warning  timeout.  This  may
           happen when the dispatcher does not increment his time
           stamp for a unusual long time. A possible  reason  for
           this is a high workload.

           <I>2</I> Dispatcher has reached error timeout. This may  hap-
           pen  when  the dispatcher has not incremented his time
           stamp for longer than 10 minutes.

           <I>3</I> The time measurement is not initialized.


     <I>info</I>:  Status message of the daemon. This value  depends  on
     the  application  which  reply to the qping request.  If the
     application does not provide any information the  info  mes-
     sage  is  "not  available".   Here  are  the possible status
     information values for the Sun Grid Engine daemons:

        qmaster:

           The info message contains information about the  qmas-
           ter threads followed by a thread state and time infor-
           mation. Each time when one of the known  threads  pass
           through  their  main  loop  the  time  information  is
           updated. Since the qmaster  has  two  message  threads
           every  message thread updates the time. This means the
           timeout for the message thread  (MT)  can  only  occur
           when no message thread is active anymore:

              THREAD_NAME: THREAD_STATE (THREAD_TIME)

              THREAD_NAME:
                 MAIN: Main thread
                 signaler: Signal thread
                 event_master: Event master thread
                 timer: Timer thread
                 worker: Worker thread
                 listener: Listener thread
                 scheduler: Scheduler thread
                 jvm: Java thread

                 The thread names above will be followed by a 3 digit number.

              THREAD_STATE:
                 R: Running
                 W: Warning
                 E: Error

              THREAD_TIME:
                 Time since last timestamp updating.

           After the dispatcher information follows an additional
           information string which describes the complete appli-
           cation status.

        execd:

           The info message contains information  for  the  execd
           job dispatcher:
              dispatcher: STATE (TIME)

           STATE:
              R: Running
              W: Warning
              E: Error

           TIME:
              Time since last timestamp updating.

        After  the  thread  information  follows  an   additional
        information   string   which  describes  the  application
        status.

  <I>Monitor</I>:  If available, displays statistics on  a  thread.  The
  data  for  each  thread is displayed in one line. The format of
  this line can be changed at any time. Only  the  master  imple-
  ments the monitoring.


  -help
     Prints a list of all options.


  -i interval
     Set qping interval time.

     The default interval time is one second. Qping will  send  a
     SIM (Status Information Message) on each interval time.


  -info
     Show full status information (see -f for  more  information)
     and  exit.  The  exit  value 0 indicates no error. On errors
     qping returns with 1.


  -noalias
     Ignore   host_aliases   file,   which    is    located    at
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>host</I>_<I>aliases</I>.   If  this  option is
     used it is not necessary to set any Sun Grid Engine environ-
     ment variable.


  -ssl
     This option can be used to specify  an  SSL  (Secure  Socket
     Layer)  configuration.  The qping will use the configuration
     to connect to services running SSL. If the SGE settings file
     is  not  sourced,  you  have  to  use the -noalias option to
     bypass the need for the SGE_ROOT environment variable.   The
     following  environment  variables  are  used to specify your
     certificates:
       SSL_CA_CERT_FILE - CA certificate file
       SSL_CERT_FILE    - certificates file
       SSL_KEY_FILE     - key file
       SSL_RAND_FILE    - rand file


  -tcp
     This option is used to select TCP/IP as the protocol used to
     connect to other services.


  -nonewline
     Dump output will not have a linebreak within a  message  and
     binary messages are not unpacked.


  -dump
     This option allows an administrator to observe the  communi-
     cation  protocol data flow of a Sun Grid Engine service dae-
     mon. The qping -dump instruction must be started as root and
     on the same host where the observed daemon is running.

     The output is written to stdout.  The  environment  variable
     "SGE_QPING_OUTPUT_FORMAT"  can be set to hide columns, set a
     default column width or to set a hostname output format. The
     value of the environment variable can be set to any combina-
     tion of the following specifiers separated by a space  char-
     acter:
          "h:X"   -&gt; hide column X
          "s:X"   -&gt; show column X
          "w:X:Y" -&gt; set width of column X to Y
          "hn:X"  -&gt; set hostname output parameter X.
                     X values are "long" or "short"

     Start qping -help to see which columns are available.



  -dump_tag tag [param]
     This option has the same the same meaning as -dump, but  can
     provide  more  information by specifying the debug level and
     message types qping should print:
        -dump_tag ALL &lt;debug level&gt;
           This  option  shows  all   possible   debug   messages
           (APP+MSG)  for the debug levels, ERROR, WARNING, INFO,
           DEBUG and DPRINTF. The contacted service must  support
           this  kind  of debugging. This option is not currently
           implemented.
        -dump_tag APP &lt;debug level&gt;
           This option shows only application debug messages  for
           the  debug  levels,  ERROR,  WARNING,  INFO, DEBUG and
           DPRINTF. The contacted service must support this  kind
           of  debugging.   This  option  is not currently imple-
           mented.
        -dump_tag MSG
           This option has the same behavior as the -dump option.


  host
     Host where daemon is running.



  port
     Port which daemon has bound (used sge_qmaster/sge_execd port
     number).


  name
     Name of communication endpoint  ("qmaster"  or  "execd").  A
     communication  endpoint  is  a  triplet of hostname/endpoint
     name/endpoint id (e.g. hostA/qmaster/1 or subhost/qstat/4).


  id
     Id of communication endpoint ("1" for daemons)
