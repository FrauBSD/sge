DESCRIPTION
     The Transparent Resource Manager (TRM) extension to the Grid
     Engine  Database  Interface  (GDI) of Grid Engine simplifies
     integration of (parallel)  applications  with  Grid  Engine.
     Access  is  provided to information which describes the run-
     time environment of a Grid Engine job.  In many  cases  this
     information   can   be   used   to   optimize   runtime   of
     jobs/applications  by  adapting  its  behavior  to   runtime
     environment or load situation.

     The following is a description of the basic functionality of
     all Grid Engine TRM GDI functions:

  sge_gdi_host_attribute
     Returns value  of  the  requested  attribute  at  the  host.
     Depending  on  the  attribute  this  can  be a load value, a
     statically configured value or  a  consumable  resource.  On
     error  NULL  is  returned.  Otherwise  a pointer is returned
     which  points  to  a  static  address.  Please   note   that
     <I>sge</I>_<I>gdi</I>_<I>host</I>_<I>attribute</I>  will fail if the Grid Engine GDI was
     not successfully initialized by use of <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/sge_gdi_setup.html">sge_gdi_setup(3)</A></B>.

  sge_gdi_host_scaling
     Returns the scaling factor which is used to scale the  given
     load  value from the host. The scaling values for a host can
     be modified using the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> command.  If  no  scaling  is
     active for the attribute a value of 1 is returned.  On error
     -1 is returned. Please note that  <I>sge</I>_<I>gdi</I>_<I>host</I>_<I>scaling</I>  will
     fail if the Grid Engine GDI was not successfully initialized
     by use of <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/sge_gdi_setup.html">sge_gdi_setup(3)</A></B>.

  sge_gdi_host_nslots
     Returns the number of slots the job got from the Grid Engine
     scheduler  for  the given host. This number can be important
     in case of  multithreaded  parallel  applications.   If  the
     jobid  is  0  the  value  of  the JOB_ID environment is used
     instead.   On  error  0  is  returned.  Please   note   that
     <I>sge</I>_<I>gdi</I>_<I>host</I>_<I>nslots</I> will fail if the Grid Engine GDI was not
     successfully initialized by use of <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/sge_gdi_setup.html">sge_gdi_setup(3)</A></B>.

  sge_gdi_myhost_attribute
     Returns the value of the requested attribute  at  the  local
     host.   Depending on the attribute this can be a load value,
     a statically configured value or a consumable  resource.  On
     error  NULL  is  returned.  Otherwise  a pointer is returned
     which points to  a  static  address.  <I>sge</I>_<I>gdi</I>_<I>host</I>_<I>attribute</I>
     should  be  called  without  setting  up the Grid Engine GDI
     since this is done inside of this function.

  sge_gdi_myhost_scaling
     Returns the scaling factor which is used to scale the  given
     load  value  from  the  local host. The scaling values for a
     host can be modified using the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> command. If no scal-
     ing  is  active  for the attribute a value of 1 is returned.
     On error -1 is returned.  <I>sge</I>_<I>gdi</I>_<I>myhost</I>_<I>scaling</I>  should  be
     called  without setting up the Grid Engine GDI since this is
     done inside of this function.

  sge_gdi_myhost_nslots
     Returns the number of slots the job got from the Grid Engine
     scheduler  for  the local host. This number can be important
     in case of  multithreaded  parallel  applications.   If  the
     jobid  is  0  the  value  of  the JOB_ID environment is used
     instead.  On  error  0  is  returned.  <I>sge</I>_<I>gdi</I>_<I>myhost</I>_<I>nslots</I>
     should  be  called  without  setting  up the Grid Engine GDI
     since this is done inside of this function.
