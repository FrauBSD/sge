NAME
     drmaa_job_ps, drmaa_control, - Monitor and control jobs

SYNOPSIS
     #include "drmaa.h"

     int drmaa_job_ps(
          const char *job_id,
          int *remote_ps,
          char *error_diagnosis,
          size_t error_diag_len
     );

     int drmaa_control(
          const char *jobid,
          int action,
          char *error_diagnosis,
          size_t error_diag_len
     );

DESCRIPTION
     The drmaa_job_ps() function returns the status  of  the  Sun
     Grid  Engine  job  <I>job</I>_<I>id</I>  into  the  integer  pointed to by
     <I>remote</I>_<I>ps</I>. Possible return values are

          DRMAA_PS_UNDETERMINED        job status cannot be determined
          DRMAA_PS_QUEUED_ACTIVE       job is queued and active
          DRMAA_PS_SYSTEM_ON_HOLD      job is queued and in system hold
          DRMAA_PS_USER_ON_HOLD        job is queued and in user hold
          DRMAA_PS_USER_SYSTEM_ON_HOLD job is queued and in user and system hold
          DRMAA_PS_RUNNING             job is running
          DRMAA_PS_SYSTEM_SUSPENDED    job is system suspended
          DRMAA_PS_USER_SUSPENDED      job is user suspended
          DRMAA_PS_DONE                job finished normally
          DRMAA_PS_FAILED              job finished, but failed

     Jobs' user hold and user suspend states  can  be  controlled
     via  <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_control.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">drmaa_control(3)</A></B>.  For affecting system hold and system
     suspend states the appropriate Sun  Grid  Engine  interfaces
     must be used.

  drmaa_control()
     The drmaa_control() function applies control  operations  on
     Sun  Grid Engine jobs.  <I>jobid</I> may contain either an Sun Grid
     Engine jobid or `DRMAA_JOB_IDS_SESSION_ALL' to refer to  all
     jobs   submitted  during  the  DRMAA  session  opened  using
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_init.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">drmaa_init(3)</A></B>.  Legal values for <I>action</I> and  their  meanings
     are:

          DRMAA_CONTROL_SUSPEND        suspend the job
          DRMAA_CONTROL_RESUME         resume the job,
          DRMAA_CONTROL_HOLD           put the job on-hold
          DRMAA_CONTROL_RELEASE        release the hold on the job
          DRMAA_CONTROL_TERMINATE      kill the job

     The DRMAA suspend/resume operations are  equivalent  to  the
     use  of  `-sj  &lt;jobid&gt;'  and `-usj &lt;jobid&gt;' options with Sun
     Grid Engine <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qmod(1)</A></B>.  The DRMAA hold/release operations  are
     equivalent  to  the  use  of  Sun  Grid  Engine <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhold.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qhold(1)</A></B> and
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrls.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qrls(1)</A></B>.  The DRMAA terminate operation is equivalent to the
     use  of  Sun  Grid  Engine <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">qdel(1)</A></B>.  Only user hold and user
     suspend can be controlled via <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_control.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">drmaa_control(3)</A></B>.  For affect-
     ing  system  hold  and system suspend states the appropriate
     Sun Grid Engine interfaces must be used.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Sun Grid Engine
                    cell to be used. To address a Sun Grid Engine
                    cell Sun Grid Engine uses (in  the  order  of
                    precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon    successful    completion,    drmaa_job_ps(),     and
     drmaa_control()  return  DRMAA_ERRNO_SUCCESS.  Other  values
     indicate an error. Up to <I>error</I>_<I>diag</I>_<I>len</I> characters of  error
     related  diagnosis  information  is  then  provided  in  the
     buffer, <I>error</I>_<I>diagnosis</I>.

ERRORS
     The drmaa_job_ps(), and drmaa_control() will fail if:

  DRMAA_ERRNO_INTERNAL_ERROR
     Unexpected  or  internal  DRMAA  error,  like  system   call
     failure, etc.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_DRM_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
     Could not contact DRM system for this request.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_AUTH_FAILURE
     The specified request was not processed successfully due  to
     authorization failure.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_INVALID_ARGUMENT
     The input value for an argument is invalid.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_NO_ACTIVE_SESSION
     Failed because there is no active session.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_NO_MEMORY
     Failed allocating memory.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_INVALID_JOB
     The specified job does not exist.

     The drmaa_control() will fail if:

  DRMAA_ERRNO_RESUME_INCONSISTENT_STATE
     The job is not suspended. The resume  request  will  not  be
     processed.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_SUSPEND_INCONSISTENT_STATE
     The job is not running and thus cannot be suspended.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_HOLD_INCONSISTENT_STATE
     The job cannot be moved to a hold state.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_RELEASE_INCONSISTENT_STATE
     The job is not in a hold state.
