___INFO__MARK_END__

The load parameters reported by the execution daemon per default currently
are:

arch : An architecture string compiled into the sge_execd describing the
       operating system architecture for which the execd is targeted.
       Possible values are:

       aix51         for IBM AIX 5.1, 5.3
       darwin-x86    for Apple Mac OS/X x86
       darwin-ppc    for Apple Mac OS/X PowerPC
       hp11          for HP HP-UX 11.x 32-bit
       hp11-64       for HP HP-UX 11.x 64-bit
       lx24-amd64    for Linux 2.4, 2.6 x64
       lx24-x86      for Linux 2.4, 2.6 x86
       lx24-ia64     for Linux 2.4, 2.6 IA64
       sol-sparc64   for Sun Solaris Sparc64
       sol-x86       for Sun Solaris x86
       sol-amd64     for Sun Solaris x64
       win32-x86     for Windows x86

       Note, that a sge_execd for a particular architecture may run on
       multiple OS versions.  In this case, the architecture string
       delivered by the execution daemon may be misleading.

num_proc : The number of processors provided by the execution host.  The
           host is in this case defined by a single Internet address, i.e. 
           rack mounted multi host systems are counted as a cluster rather
           than a single multi headed machine.

The following load information is not available under IBM AIX. For
these operating systems the IBM loadsensor script in the Grid Engine
distribution in <sge_root>/util/resources/loadsensors needs to be installed:

load_short      : The short time average OS run queue length. It is the
                  first of the value triple reported by the uptime(1)
                  command. Many implementations provide a 1 minute average
                  with this value
load_medium     : The medium time average OS run queue length. It is the
                  second of the value triple reported by the uptime(1)
                  command. Many implementations provide a 5 minute average
                  with this value
load_long       : The long time average OS run queue length. It is the
                  third of the value triple reported by the uptime(1)
                  command. Many implementations provide a 10 or 15 minute
                  average with this value
load_avg        : The same as load_medium.
np_load_short   : The same as load_short but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.
np_load_medium  : The same as load_medium but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.
np_load_long    : The same as load_long but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.
np_load_avg     : The same as load_avg but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.
cpu             : The percentage of CPU time not in idle state.

The following load information is NOT available under IBM AIX:

mem_free        : The amount of free memory. 
swap_free       : The amount of free swap memory.
virtual_free    : The sum of mem_free and swap_free.
mem_used        : The amount of used memory. 
swap_used       : The amount of used swap space.
virtual_used    : The sum of mem_used and swap_used.
mem_total       : The total amount of memory (free+used).
swap_total      : The total amount of swap space (free+used).
virtual_total   : The sum of mem_total and swap_total.

The following load information is ONLY available under Windows:

display_win_gui : The host is capable of displaying the GUI of a Windows job.

The following load information is ONLY available unter Linux with 
kernel >= 2.6.16 and Solaris 10.

m_topology      : The host cpu topology string reported by an execution host.
                  Might be a 'NONE' if the topology cannot be
                  determined or it is a string consisting of the upper and
                  lowercase letters S, C and c. The sequence of letters
                  within that string represents the hardware topology where
                  S represents a socket and C or c a core.

                  The string "SCCSCCSCCSCC" will returned by a host that
                  has 4 sockets where each of those sockets has two cores.
                  All cores are available because all C's appear in capital
                  letters.

                  If lowercase letters are used then this means that the
                  corresponding core is already in use because there is at
                  least one running GE job bound to that core.

                  "SCCSCcSCCscc" means that core 2 on socket 2 and also
                  core 1 and core 2 on socket 4 are in use.

m_socket        : Number of sockets available on the reporting host.
                  (e.g. "SCCSCCSCCSCC" => m_socket = 4)

m_core          : Number of cores reported for each socket on a host.
                  (e.g. "SCCSCCSCCSCC" => m_core = 2)
