                                   0(timeout) or -1(error) so that connection

                              system_tests/clients/qconf:
                              - message parsing for long host names was wrong
                              - check did not re-add the execd on failure
                              - check did unset the SGE_SINGLE_LINE environment variable

                              - procedure removed "=" from cluster queue instances:
                                e.g.: "fangorn=test2=4" was modified to
                                      "fangorn=test2 4"
                              - procedure saved host specific entries without
                                resolving the names

DT-2005-04-29-0: Testsuite: o Added junit test for issue 1595

AH-2004-07-13-0: Bugfix:    Deleted pending job appears in qstat

                            supposed to mask out running/finished jobs at qmaster
                            side. Added code in qmaster to improve diagnostics

                            rusage pointer, and narrowed the scope of the event
                            client using SG's new interface.
                            I also fixed the build on HPUX-11.
                            I still need AD to add mutex locking to
                            sge_gethostbyname() default case and sge_gethostbyaddr().
                            I also need to apply platform specific gethostbyaddr_r()
                            synamtecs to sge_gethostbyaddr().

SG-2003-09-15-1: Bugfix:    Fixed a bug in the pending ticket calculation. When
                            two projects have the same amount of shares, they
                            were combined in one functional category, which lead
                            to a wrong job order. The fcategories are now defined
                            by the references to the control structures.

                                   - in all other cases the minimum/ maximum is used
                                 - the values for attributes with ">", ">=", "<=", "<"
                                   can be overridden on a lower level, when the new
                                   value is more restrictive than the old one.

                 Enhancem.: Phase 2 of dealing with complexes in the scheduler.
                            In this version the scheduler only generetes attributes
                            in the complex lists needed by the job. This is done by
                            two filtering steps. The first filter contains the names
                            of the complexes requested by the job, the second
                            contains all names avaiable at the current test level(
                            global, host, queue). The test is done with the
                            complexes, which satisfy of first filter and second filter.

                            session event filtering is applied to these events.

                            #126 (qdel of just submitted job). When the signal
                            delivering bug is fixed, the timeout and the sleep
                            should be taken back.

JG-2002-04-11-0: Bugfix:    In simulation mode, job reports were not flushed
                            at (simulated) job end.

EB-2002-04-10-1: Cleanup:   Moved messages

EB-2002-04-10-0: Cleanup:   Cleanup within CULL library
                            - ADOC comments for all nonstatic functions
                            - minor modifications

JG-2002-04-09-0: Enhancem.  Further generalization of the event client
                            interface:
                            - sge_locate_scheduler -> sge_locate_event_client
                            - reinit_schedd -> reinit_event_client
                            - special handling at registration not only for
                              scheduler but any special event client
                            - make datatypes of enums and use these types
                              instead of int or u_long32 in access functions
                            - extend event client modify request to allow
                              changing of the busy state, remove special
                              handling for scheduler busy state in qmaster

JG-2002-04-08-2: Enhancem.  Performance optimization for the processing
                            of job reports.

JG-2002-04-08-1: Merge:     Merged JG-2002-03-26-1 from V53_beta2_BRANCH
                 Bugfix:    At startup qmaster removed pending messages too
                            late (after daemonizing instead of after
                            enrolling).  In rare cases (starting schedd
                            immediately after qmaster daemonized on a fast
                            machine) this could produce an error and cause a
                            delayed registration of the scheduler.

JG-2002-04-08-0: Merge:     Merged JG-2002-03-21-0 from V53_beta2_BRANCH
                 Bugfix:    prioritization of messages to qmaster could
                            block reports from execd's to qmaster and make
                            the system unusable.
                            Set "no prioritization" as default, behaviour
                            can be changed via env variable
                            SGE_PRIORITY_TAGS.
                 Enhancem.  Performance enhancement for the deletion of large
                            numbers of jobs.

CR-2002-04-05-2: Bugfix:    Fixed compiler warning in ptf.c

JG-2002-04-05-3: Doc:       Linked both versions of the event client interface

                            overview document.

JG-2002-04-05-2: Doc:       Updated HTML documentation for the event client
                            interface generated from adoc comments.

CR-2002-04-05-1: Testsuite: - reinserted rsh test on testsuite setup
                              configuration
                            - merged large_cluster test from
                              V52_beat2_BRANCH

JG-2002-04-05-1: Cleanup:   removed meanwhile meaningless comments in
                            qlogin_starter module.

CR-2002-04-05-0: Testsuite: - more function parameters for logfile_wait()
                 Enhancem.  - new procedure: close_logfile_wait()
                            - output changes
                            - new procedure: get_schedd_messages_file()
                            - new procedure: check_schedd_messages()

JG-2002-04-05-0: Enhancem.  Further cleanup and enhancement of the
                            event client interface:
                            - general implementation for flushing of events
                              replaces special handling for scheduler in
                              qmaster
                            - a new "busy policy" replaces special handling for
                              scheduler with global variables in qmaster
                            - a clientdata field in the event client object is
                              used for checking of orders sequence numbers
                              instead of using a global variable
                            - lots of additional documentation

SD-2002-04-04-1: Feature:   Merges from V53_beta2_sx6_BRANCH
                            SX architecture updates

                            - Set resource limits after setting the OS
                              job id in builtin_starter.c so that job
                              resource limits will work on the SX-6.
                            Added support to control restart timeout
                            delays using environment variables.

CR-2002-04-03-0  Testsuite: - replaced rsh calls with start_remote_proc()
                              and open_remote_spawn_process() calls
                            - new procedures:
                              wait_for_remote_file()
                                  -> wait for file to appear on remote host
                                     (should fix NFS problems)
                              init_logfile_wait()
                              logfile_wait()
                                  -> new tail mechanism for parsing logfiles
                              washing_machine()
                              get_qmaster_messages_file()
                              get_execd_messages_file()
                                  -> get path to messages files
                            - enhanced procedures:
                              start_remote_prog()

JG-2002-04-02-2  Feature    Compile time switch -DCULL_NO_HASH to
                            switch of hashing of cull lists - mainly

JG-2001-11-20-0: Feature:   Generalized event client interface.
                            The former event client interface was very
                            scheduler specific.  Only one event client - the
                            scheduler - could register.  Now any number of
                            event client can register at qmaster and receive
                            events.
                            A sample event client can be found in
                            clients/qevent.  Further cleanup steps and
                            documentation still has to be done.  A

AA-2001-11-19-0: Bugfix:    Qmon core dump in sharetree for empty sharetree
                            when using Find

JG-2001-11-15-0: Feature:   Performance/Scalability optimization:
                            Defined hash tables on a number of objects to
                            speed up search operations.
                            Changed the order in which non unique hashed
                            objects are stored - some code relies on getting
                            them in the same order they were stored.

EB-2001-11-13-0: Bugfix:    Qmaster did not change the reschedule unknown
                            value immediately after using the qconf command.
                 Issue:     #92

                              (shutdown/restart scheduler and master)
                              command line -> master_debug, schedd_debug and
                                      display master and scheduler can now
                                      be started in debug mode
                              - new procedure: wait_for_unknown_load
                              - (sge_procedures.tcl)


JG-2001-11-08-1: Feature:   New qconf options:
                               -Auser: add user from file
                               -Muser: modify user from file
                            Corrected sorting of options in help output.
                 Issue:     #89

JG-2001-11-08-0: Bugfix:    Updated recent GDI versions for version check

JG-2001-11-07-1: Bugfix: Retrieving a string value from a cull object field
                 and setting this value again for the same field produced a
                 memory access error.

JG-2001-11-07-0: Adjust MAKEOPT for aimk option -qmake to reflect latest
                 changes to qmake.

                 could meet an old instance of the same job if the
                 scheduler was to fast.

AH-2001-11-05-0: Fixes with qstat -pe <pe_name> and qselect -pe <pe_name>
                 - 'all' keyword in PE's queue_list was not honoured
                 - non-parallel queues were selected
                 Bugtraq: #4584673


JG-2001-11-02-1: qstat -j aborted when writing usage of pe tasks

JG-2001-11-02-0: qmake: Does not need to export variable PWD when executing
                        remote tasks (qrsh option -v PWD) - PWD is setup
                        correctly by execd/shepherd.

CR-2001-10-31-0: Testsuite:
                   Added new test for share tree in

                  - Changed several parameter for sgeee scheduler

JG-2001-10-29-0: Removed explicit hash tables on job lists in
                 qmaster and scheduler - they are no longer needed,
                 as cull hashing functionality was enabled for job
                 lists.

AH-2001-10-29-0: Qmaster:
                 - cancel resend of jobs to execd on forced job deletion

AA-2001-10-29-1: security files that are no longer needed removed

EB-2001-10-29-0: Fix for sgeee scheduler
                  - empty sharetree && sharetreetickets > 0 caused
                    fatal exit of scheduler

CR-2001-10-26-1: Testsuite:
                  - bugfix for path_alias check: problems with file
                    creating on NFS directory. The check will now make
                    sure that the correct/updated path_alias files are
                    used (diffing file output on each execution host in
                    setup procedure).

CR-2001-10-26-0: Source:
                  - Added variable initialization
                  - Removed double defined message
                 Testsuite:
                  - using cvs -P parameter for source update
                  - issue #8 (one rlogin at startup):
                  - new parameter "close_rlogin" for compatibility

EB-2001-10-25-0: Modified qdel, qmon, qmaster
                  - removed job attribute vom "Job Customize" dialog
                  - bugfix: qdel -u <list of users>
                  - moved messages into msg_*.h file

JG-2001-10-25-0: Fixed some memory leaks

JG-2001-10-23-0: Fixed a bug in the implementation of non unique hash tables:
                 The key data has to be duplicated in the hash table.
                 Therefore a duplication function has to be passed when
                 creating a new hash table.

JG-2001-10-22-0: Fixed a memory access error in the cull hash implementation

EB-2001-10-20-0: Added 'const' in libraries

JG-2001-10-18-0: Execd:
                  - bugfix: reporting of a parallel array jobs pe task in
                            tight integration could fail.
                  - use cull hashing iterators for searches in job list

JG-2001-10-17-0: (Issue #57)
                 Sparc Linux port (32 bit). Grid Engine platform slinux.
                 The port is restricted to SGE as the pdc module had to be
                 disabled for slinux (aimk variable COMPILE_DC).

JG-2001-10-16-0: Implemented the use of hash tables for cull lists.
                 The list definition (libs/gdi/sge_*L.h) contains information,
                 for which data fields hash tables shall be generated.
                 Hash tables are created and maintained by the cull list
                 access functions (lCreateList, lAppendElem etc.) and are used
                 by the cull search functions (lGetElem*).
                 Defined default hash tables for the most used cull lists.
                 Increased the GDI version - the spooling file format and
                 the message format changed.

EB-2001-10-11-1: Changed MAX_SEQNUM from 999,999 to 9,999,999.
                 - changed qstat output format

EB-2001-10-11-0: Changed spool behaviour for (array) jobs
                 - beared down the 32765 subdirectory limit
                 - added some tuning parameters for job spooling
                 - collected duplicated code used in master and execd

CR-2001-10-10-1: Testsuite:
                 - closed issue # 9 (Create a new test for file parsing)

CR-2001-10-10-0: Testsuite:
                 - new command line option: mfile FILE
                   (don't mail messages, write it to file)
                 - new optional parameter for procedure "wait_for_jobstart"
                   (do a qconf -tsm before waiting for jobstart)

CR-2001-10-09-2: (sge_rusage.c)
                 - Issue #68 (The accounting file handles only entries < 2048
                              chars/line)

CR-2001-10-09-1: (rmon_macros.c)
                 - don't use vnsprintf() for ALPHA4 and IRIX6

CR-2001-10-09-0: (parse_job_cull.c)
                 - Issue #67 (long lines in sge_request files causes bus error
                             in qsub)
                 - removed some local char str[1024] definitions and replaced
                   it with error_string buffer one function level above
                 (rmon_macros.c)
                 - using vnsprintf() system call as default (instead of vsprintf)
                   This should prevent a buffer overflow error

JG-2001-10-09-0: Added statistics for our hashtable implementation that gives
                 following info:
                  - size of hashtable and number of elements stored
                  - number of empty hash chains
                  - maximum and average chain length
                 When a hashtable is resized and log_level is set to log_debug,
                 statistics and profiling information is output to messages
                 files.

JG-2001-10-08-0: Enabled options -h and -hold_jid for qrsh
                 Bugtraq #4511859

AH-2001-10-05-0: Removed warning message in execd

EB-2001-10-05-0: minor modifications
                 - remove/displace code
                 - comments/formatting

JG-2001-10-04-0: Generalized our hash table implementation to support any
                 data type for keys.
                 Hash table uses hash and compare functions to be specified
                 when a table is created.
                 Hash and compare functions for strings and u_long32 are
                 provided.

EB-2001-10-04-0: (Issue #7)
                 - changed spool behaviour for (array) jobs

AH-2001-10-02-0: Schedd: Moved code handling 'forced' attributes to a section
                 handling other static matchings. Static matchings can be done
                 independently of consumables/load values and thus needs be done
                 less frequent

SD-2001-10-01-0: Updated the SGEEE pending job algorithm.

                 WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING

                 This update changes the binary job structure spooled to disk.
                 This means that if you are already running with the open source
                 code, you will need to delete all pending and active jobs before
                 running with the new SGE binaries. This is true if you are running
                 either SGE or SGEEE.

CR-2001-09-26-0: Testsuite:
                 - new setup file version
                 (new parameter "list_of_submit_only_hosts")

AH-2001-09-21-0: Improved array-job performance in schedd

CR-2001-09-21-0: Testsuite:
                 - New procedure in file_procedures module:
                   create_path_aliasing_file()
                 - Issue #54 : New test: sge_aliases file

CR-2001-09-18-0: Testsuite:
                 - sending CR (carriage return) before starting remote command
                   (to stop eventually switched on correct questions) on rlogin
                   call
                 - wait longer before sending password (some login daemons
                   don't accept fast password typing)

CR-2001-09-17-0: Fixed issue #60 "COMMPROC ALLREADY REGISTERED" error

AH-2001-09-14-2: Fixed error with job array causing dispatch of the last
                 array-job being postponed to the follow-up scheduling interval

JG-2001-09-12-0: (Issue #58)
                 - scheduler optimization: sorting of hosts is only done
                   when really necessary.
                 - schedd can output profiling information - set schedd_params
                   to profile
                 - some smaller bugfixes

AA-2001-09-06-0: Fixed y out of range of allowed Xserver values in QControl
                 This limits the number of displayable qs to 2758

JG-2001-09-03-0: (Issue #51)
                 - PWD was set incorrectly for jobs submitted with qsub -cwd
                   if a path mapping was active (sge_aliases file)
                 - qrsh does no longer use the PWD variable to determine
                   target job working directory but jobs configuration

CR-2001-08-31-0: Testsuite:
                 - issue #10 shutdown_system_daemon does not work for some platforms
                 - start_remote_prog procedure can now export user environment on
                   remote host

EB-2001-08-30-0: Removed help output from qconf concerning 'meattr'
                 and 'Meattr' (Issue# 50)

AA-2001-08-28-0: Fixed task array job handling in qmon submit dialogue (Issue# 48)

EB-2001-08-27-0: Fixed segmentation fault in qstat, qhost, qmon (Issue# 48)
                 - large, fragmented job arrays caused segmentation
                   fault in qstat when the task id range list should be
                   printed
                 - hold of a list of array tasks in the job control dialog
                   caused only the last one to be set into the hold-state

CR-2001-08-23-2: Testsuite:
                 - using full path name for files to check in procedure
                   check_executable_files

CR-2001-08-23-1: Testsuite:
                 - removed add_proc_error call in compile_source procedure
                   (output buffer overflow error). Now the error is only
                   reported in the normal testsuite output. In case of
                   parallel compiling more architectures this error message
                   sometimes appears.

CR-2001-08-23-0: Testsuite:
