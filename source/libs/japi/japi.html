<H1>Overview</H1>
<P>The JAPI library is a layer on top of 
<A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/%7Echeckout%7E/gridengine/source/libs/gdi/gdi.html?content-type=text/html">libgdi</A>, 
<A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/%7Echeckout%7E/gridengine/doc/devel/eventclient.html?content-type=text/html">libevc</A> 
. JAPI collects the specific qualities of both modules to provide a to-the-point interface 
providing those operations a typical Grid Engine end user depends upon. That is submission 
of jobs and array-jobs, enquire and control of job status, synchronizing with jobs end as 
well as examining the manner how a job finished. In contrast to this manipulating the 
configuration of a Grid Engine queue is typically not done by end users. The design of the 
core JAPI functions was vitally influenced by the interface specification the 
<A HREF="http://www.drmaa.org">GGF DRMAA working group</A>
developed. Note that currently only qsub(1)-ish jobs can be submitted through JAPI.</P>
<H1>Implementation</H1>
<P>Constraints of the protocol used by libevc, made it necessary to run a service thread 
in background of JAPI. The purpose of this thread is to wait for new events
sent by Grid Engine qmaster, acknowledge received events to qmaster and provide 
information related to job states in a shared data structure that is maintained 
to implement services certain JAPI calls base upon (i.e. japi_wait(3)). The JAPI 
library is a MT safe library allowing any number of application threads to use JAPI 
services without explicit synchronization.</P>
