/**
 * This interface represents a template to be used for the creation of a job.
 * The properties set on a JobTemplate instance are used to create a new job and
 * set up the new job's environment.
 *
 * <p>There is a 1:n relationship between JobTemplate instances and jobs.  A
 * single JobTemplate instance can be used to submit any number of jobs.  Once a
 * job has been submitted, e.g. via Session.runJob(), the JobTemplate instance
 * no longer has any affect on that job.  Changes made to the JobTemplate
 * instance will have no affect on already running jobs.  Deleting the
 * JobTemplate instance (via Session.deleteJobTemplate()) also has no effect on
 * running jobs.</p>
 *
 * <p>Once a JobTemplate instance has been created
 * (via Session.createJobTemplate()), it is the responsibility of the developer
 * to delete it when no longer needed (via Session.deleteJobTemplate ()).
 * Failure to do so may result in a memory leak.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>public static void main(String[] args) {
 *   SessionFactory factory = SessionFactory.getFactory();
 *   Session session = factory.getSession();
 *
 *   try {
 *      session.init(&quot;&quot;);
 *      JobTemplate jt = session.createJobTemplate();
 *      jt.setRemoteCommand(&quot;sleeper.sh&quot;);
 *      jt.setWorkingDirectory(&quot;:&quot; + HOME_DIRECTORY + &quot;/jobs&quot;);
 *      jt.setArgs(Collections.singletonList(&quot;5&quot;));
 *
 *      String id = session.runJob(jt);
 *
 *      session.deleteJobTemplate(jt);
 *      session.exit();
 *   }
 *   catch (DrmaaException e) {
 *      System.out.println(&quot;Error: &quot; + e.getMessage ());
 *   }
