/**
 * The PartialTimestamp is a subclass of java.util.Calendar that allows for a
 * partially specified time that is resolved to the soonest matching time that
 * is in the future at the time of resolution.  That is to say that if one
 * creates a PartialTimestamp instance and sets the hour to 10am and the minute
 * to 0, and one resolves the time, i.e. PartialTimestamp.getTime(), at 11:01am
 * on November 24th, the PartialTimestamp will resolve to 10:00am on November
 * 25th, as that time is the soonest time which matches the specified fields and
 * is in the future.  If one later resolves that same PartialTimestamp instance
 * at 9:34am on December 1st, it will resolve to 10:00am on December 1st.
 *
 * <p>There are only two ways to resolve the time: getTime() and
 * getTimeInMillis().  All other means of accessing field values will return
 * unresolved values.  If the PartialTimestamp class is unable to resolve a
 * field because of other unset fields, it will simply leave the field
 * unresolved.  For example, if the DAY_OF_MONTH is set to 42, and the MONTH is
 * unset, the DAY_OF_MONTH will remain as 42.  If later the MONTH is set, the
 * DAY_OF_MONTH may be resolved to an in-range value.  ("<b>May</b>," because if
 * the MONTH is FEBRUARY, the YEAR and CENTURY are also needed to be able to
 * resolve the DAY_OF_MONTH.)</p>
 *
 * <p>Whereever possible and sensible, the PartialTimestamp class mimics the
 * functionality of the GregorianCalendar class.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since the PartialTimestamp only supports dates within the epoch, the ERA
 * field is always AD, and hence is not used.  The DRMAA specification, requires
 * that the year be handled as two separate fields, one for the first n-2 digits
 * (century) and one for the last two digits.  Because of the symantics of
 * extending the Calendar class, the CENTURY field is just an alias for the ERA
 * field, and the ERA contains the century data.  When using the
 * PartialTimestmap class, the ERA field should not be used.</p>
 *
 * <p>When rolling a date field, if the PartialTimestamp doesn't have enough
 * information to determine the field's valid value range, e.g. when rolling the
 * DAY_OF_MONTH while MONTH is unset, an assumption will be made.  The
 * assumptions a PartialTimestamp instance may make are: a year is 365 days or
 * 53 weeks, and a month is 31 days or 5 weeks.</p>
 *
 * <p>The PartialTimestamp class adds the idea of field modifiers to the
 * Calendar class.  Field modifiers are accessed via the setModifier() and
 * getModifier() methods.  A modifier represents a number that will be added to
 * the value of the field.  This is useful because in a PartialTimestamp
 * instance, it may necessary to add to an unset field, for example to indicate
 * the concept of "tomorrow."  If an add() method or out of range set() method
 * attempts to modify an unset field, the resulting modifier will be stored as
 * the modifier for that field.  For example, if the MONTH is set to DECEMBER,
 * and the YEAR is unset, and 1 is added to the MONTH, the result will be that
 * the MONTH is set to JANUARY, the year is still unset, and the YEAR
 * modifier is set to 1.  If later the YEAR is set to 97, the modifier will be
 * applied, resulting in a year of 98.  To avoid unwanted modifiers, use the
 * roll() method instead of the add() method.</p>
 *
 * <p>The roll() method in the PartialTimestamp class is very simple.  It does
 * not take into account Daylight Savings Time or other complications, as does
 * the roll() method of the GregorianCalendar.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>public static void main (String[] args) {
 *   SessionFactory factory = SessionFactory.getFactory ();
 *   Session session = factory.getSession ();
 *
 *   try {
 *      session.init (null);
 *      JobTemplate jt = session.createJobTemplate ();
 *      jt.setRemoteCommand ("sleeper.sh");
 *      jt.setArgs (new String[] {"5"});
 *
 *      PartialTimestamp date = new PartialTimestamp ();
 *
 *      // Run the job on the first of the month at 11:30
 *      date.set (PartialTimestamp.DATE, 1);
 *      date.set (PartialTimestamp.HOUR_OF_DAY, 11);
 *      date.set (PartialTimestamp.MINUTE, 30);
 *
 *      jt.setStartTime (date);
 *
 *      String id = session.runJob (jt);
 *
 *      session.deleteJobTemplate (jt);
 *      session.exit ();
 *   }
 *   catch (DrmaaException e) {
 *      System.out.println ("Error: " + e.getMessage ());
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
