# This file contains cell wide defaults which commands are
# to be queued from within a qtcsh session. 
#
# See qtask(5) for a detailed description of the file format.
#
#
#
# Sample #1 redirects certain file io intensive commands 
# to the fileserver machine.
#    
#cat -l file_srv=true -cwd
#grep -l file_srv=true -cwd
#egrep -l file_srv=true -cwd
#
#
#
# Sample #2 redirects certain GUI applications to one of 
# the machines being configured as application
# server. The prefixed exclamation mark prevents 
# overriding of the default redirection for the
# netscape command.
