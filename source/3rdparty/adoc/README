ADOC has been tested successfully on several platforms however

  *** Please report any problems to <ferber@rpk.mach.uni-karlsruhe.de> ***

The ADOC scanner reads your source code and creates Autodocs and/or Texinfo
source (with references in the SEE ALSO sections).  It is an enhanced
version of Bill Koesters `Autodoc' program as of 21-Aug-89 which is part
of C=ommodore's Native Developer Kit (NDK).



FEATURES:

  * ADOC is fully dynamic, i.e. there is no limitation in line length or
    file size or the number of functions but only the available memory.

  * ADOC is system independant and *fast* !

  * ADOC creates Texinfo, a format which allows further conversion to
    DVI (TeX), Info (makeinfo), Amigaguide (makeinfo, makeguide), HTML, ...


A new tool `CODA' is now part of this distribution.  CODA converts Autodocs
to C-Language comments which allows further processing with ADOC.
