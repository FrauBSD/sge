              CHANGES since adoc-0.17 beta 3 (the first release)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Tue Mar 21 22:13:37 1995

  * Autodoc default was `--preserve-order' and there was no switch to
    sort the entries.  ADOC now sorts the entries by default as documented.


Wed Mar 22 14:32:27 1995

  * Removed the undocumented "hidden feature" which allowed combining
    `-1 -o file' to `-o1 file'.

  * `--revision' replaces `--edition' and `--edition' now does what it says:
    it defines the REVISION macro.

  * `-h' option qualifier added to avoid line breaks on 80 column terminals:

      `-h0'   prints only the "usage:" string
      `-h1'   prints only the "short" options (those with one `-')
      `-h2'   printd only the "long" options (those with two `--')

    `-h' alone defaults to `-h3' which prints both "long" and "short" options"


Thu Mar 23 12:58:38 1995

  * Added the `-Y' option which allows autodoc comments to begin in any column.
    (They normally have to begin in column 1).

    There is no checking yet whether or not the indentation is equal in every
    line of the comment.  (Do we really need that?)

  * There is only one warning now for lines in autodoc comments without a white
    space after the first column black character.  These lines are ignored.

  * A (char *)0 reference has been fixed which happened in case of an 
    unterminated comment at the end of a file.

  * Added `-u' option which allows the removal of the body text indentation.
    This is useful in texinfo mode because the texinfo @example block is
    indented automatically.

    Warning: This option removes *all* white spaces at the beginning of a line
             and that might destroy your textual layout.
             This is why this option is not documented and might be removed in
             future revisions.


Fri Mar 24 13:24:46 1995

  * Added `-j' option which might be what you need instead of `-u'.  (-:

  * Adoc now replaces the the leading "black" character of body text lines with
    a single space if the black character is followed by a space.  Otherwise
    (if it is followed by a TAB or a NL) adoc only removes the back character.
    This guarantees an equal indentation of body text lines indented with tabs
    and those indented with spaces.  (This was a bug until today)

Fri Mar 24 20:40:49 1995

  * Made the period `.' a legal character for an identifier in the comment
    header.  This allows headers of the form

                  /****** myfirst.library/greatfun *******...

  * Wrote the CODA tool which is now distributed together with adoc
    CODA converts autodocs to C language comments which allows further
    processing with ADOC

  * Found another DICE bug which caused crashes on my system :'(

           z=((++x) % y)      is not equal to      x++; z= x%y


Sat Mar 25 10:55:21 1995

  * ADOC now adds an untitled section if there is text without a section
    heading at the beginning of an autodoc comment.

  * added the `-Z' option which avoids writing the "Function Index" in
    `--texinfo' mode.

Mon Apr  3 17:14:12 1995

  * Fixed a bug in the scanner's strip() function which did not remove all
    white spaces from a string which consists entirely of white spaces.

  * Documented the @w{} cheat which allows TeX to break the page inside
    indented paragraphs in @example and @smallexample blocks.

  * ADOC now uses malloc() instead of of realloc() for initial allocations.
    (This was a problem in a SUN's libc.a)

  * References to library @chapter nodes are now recognized by the SEE ALSO 
    parser.  (New problem for the user:  A reference `f' to a function `f' 
    in a library `f' will come out as a reference to the library `f'.  The 
    function can be refered to as `f/f'.)

  * Some changes in the texinfo header have been made, especially the page 
    numbering on the title page has been removed and double sided page 
    numbering has been forced for the rest of the document.

Wed Apr 12 21:47:05 1995

  * Now using a space character instead of a slash `/' or a period `.' or a
    colon `:' as a seperator between library and function name because of 
    problems with makeinfo and makeguide which seem convert some slashes in 
    @node names to dashes and some not and then get in trouble later... hmpf!
