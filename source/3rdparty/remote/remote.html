The implementation of the qrsh feature in Gridengine makes use of operating
system facilities like rsh and rlogin.
<p>Unfortunately these programs usually lack some features:
<ul>
<li>
rsh / rlogin connect to a rshd / rlogind on a fixed port number but Gridengine
has to start (multiple) rshd / rlogind on variable port numbers</li>

<li>
rshd / rlogind do not pass correctly accounting information to their parent
process - they do not call wait to collect usage information</li>

<li>
most rshd's fail, if the user root cannot chdir to the target users (nfs
mounted) home directory</li>
</ul>
Therefore part of a Gridengine distribution are the following programs:
<ul>
<li>
rsh</li>

<li>
rlogin</li>

<li>
rshd</li>
</ul>
A special rlogin program is not yet part of Gridengine - the rlogin process
is much more complicated than rsh - we would probably not only have to
provide a special rlogind, but also the login program.
<h1>
1 Rsh</h1>
The Gridengine extended version of rsh is based on NetBSD-release, rsh.c,
CVS Revision 1.12,
<br><tt>ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch/mirror/NetBSD/NetBSD-release/src/usr.bin/rsh</tt>
<p>It has been extended by a commandline option <tt>-p &lt;port></tt> to
specify the tcp port rsh tries to access to build a connection to the corresponding
rshd and some porting had to be done to support all current Gridengine
platforms.
<h1>
2 Rshd</h1>
The Gridengine extended version of rshd is based on NetBSD-release, rshd.c,
Revision 1.16,
<br><tt>ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch/mirror/NetBSD/NetBSD-release/src/libexec/rshd</tt>
<p>The following changes have been applied:
<ul>
<li>
Port to all Gridengine platforms</li>

<li>
Set osjobid / additional group id to allow process control by Gridengine</li>

<li>
Cleaned up wait for child process to obtain usage information</li>

<li>
chdir to users homedir is done only after setuid to user to allow rsh access
even if homedir of user (nfs-mounted) is not readable by root (requires
additionally rshd option -l)</li>
</ul>

<h1>
3 rlogin</h1>
The Gridengine extended version of rlogin is based on NetBSD-release, rlogin.c,
CVS Revision 1.23,
<br><tt>ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch/mirror/NetBSD/NetBSD-release/src/usr.bin/rlogin</tt>
<p>It has been extended by a commandline option <tt>-p &lt;port></tt> to
specify the tcp port rlogin tries to access to build a connection to the
corresponding rlogind and some porting had to be done to support all current
Gridengine platforms.
