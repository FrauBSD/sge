<h2>
<font color="#660000">Grid Engine Kerberos/DCE Security Modules Overview</font></h2>
The Kerberos / DCE security modules are designed to be called by Grid Engine
in order to do the following:
<ul>
<li>
Forward the user's DCE/Kerberos credentials to the job</li>

<li>
Protect the credentials during network transfer (done automatically by
DCE and Kerberos)</li>

<li>
Authenticate the user</li>

<li>
Verify the authenticated user matches the Grid Engine user</li>
</ul>
The security modules consist of several programs which are called by Grid
Engine client programs and Grid Engine daemons.
<ul>
<li>
get_cred</li>

<br>This program builds a GSSAPI security context and gets the user's forwardable
credentials, tokenizes them into a buffer and writes them to standard output.
It is called by qsub, qsh, and qmon when submitting jobs. It is also called
by sge_qmaster on behalf of the user before a job is sent to an execution
host.
<li>
put_cred</li>

<br>This program accepts a tokenized security context from standard input,
authenticates the user, verifies that the user is who Grid Engine thinks
he is, and creates the forwarded credentials for the user. The routine
also checks to make sure the qsub request is not a replay (i.e. a qsub
request which was "stolen" and resent by a hacker so he could impersonate
the user). The put_cred program is called by the sge_qmaster and the sge_execd
on receipt of a new job. The sge_qmaster stores the credentials cache files
in /tmp/krb5cc_qmaster_&lt;job_id>. On the execution host the credentials
cache files are stored in /tmp/krb5cc_sge_&lt;job_id>.
<li>
delete_cred</li>

<br>This program deletes a set of credentials. Deleting a user's credentials
means that the user's credentials cache files are deleted. The delete_cred
program is called by the sge_qmaster and sge_execd when a job completes.
<li>
starter_cred</li>

<br>This shell script is used as a shepherd wrapper program in a DCE environment.
It executes the k5dcelogin program to turn the forwarded Kerberos TGT into
DCE credentials and then executes the sge_shepherd.


<h2>
<font color="#660000">How the security modules work</font></h2>

<ol>
<li>
qsub/qmon calls get_cred when a job is submitted to get the credentials
of the user. The tokenized credentials are sent back to qsub and are put
into the job request.</li>

<li>
The qmaster calls put_cred which authenticates the user and stores the
forwarded credentials in a credentials cache file.</li>

<li>
When a job is sent to an execution host, the qmaster calls get_cred and
sends the credentials to the execd.</li>

<li>
The execd calls put_cred which stores the credentials in a credentials
cache for the user.</li>

<li>
We set the KRB5CCNAME environment variable for the job so it points to
the job's credentials cache.</li>

<li>
(DCE-only) The execd spawns starter_cred instead of the shepherd which
executes k5dcelogin to convert the Kerberos TGT into valid DCE credentials
and then executes the shepherd program.</li>

<li>
When the job completes, execd and qmaster call delete_cred to delete the
credentials cache files</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<font color="#660000">Building and installing the binaries</font></h2>
First, you must obtain, compile and install the Kerberos libraries for
each architecture. For a DCE environment, you will also need to compile
the k5dcelogin program for each execution host architecture.
<br>To compile and install k5dcelogin, use the commands:
<br>$ aimk -dce k5dcelogin
<br>$ aimk install_k5dcelogin
<br>Before using the security modules, you must create and install the
binaries for each qmaster or execution host architecture upon which you
will be using DCE/Kerberos security.
<br>To create and install the security binaries, follow these instructions:
<ol>
<li>
Compile the binaries</li>

<br>$ cd $SGE_ROOT/security
<br>$ aimk -gss
<li>
Install the binaries</li>

<br># cd $SGE_ROOT/security
<br># aimk install</ol>

<h2>
<font color="#660000">DCE / Kerberos Configuration</font></h2>
DCE or Kerberos must be configured to recognize the "sge" principal. The
following instructions explain how to configure Kerberos or DCE. There
may be minor differences depending on your version of Kerberos or DCE.
<h4>
Kerberos Instructions</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Create a "sge" principal for each qmaster and execution host. In the example
below sdremote.hpc-mo.com is the qmaster host and o2.hpc-mo.com is an execution
host.</li>

<br># ./kadmin
<br>Enter password: xxxxxxx
<br>kadmin: addprinc -randkey sge/sdremote.hpc-mo.com
<br>Principal "sge/sdremote.hpc-mo.com@HPC-MO.COM" created.
<br>kadmin: addprinc -randkey sge/o2.hpc-mo.com
<br>Principal "sge/o2.hpc-mo.com@HPC-MO.COM" created.
<br>kadmin: quit
<li>
Put the "sge" key into the default keytab on the qmaster and execution
hosts. To do this, you need to log into each host individually and execute
the following commands substituting the local host name for sdremote.hpc-mo.com.</li>

<br># ./kadmin
<br>Enter password: xxxxxxx
<br>kadmin: ktadd sge/sdremote.hpc-mo.com
<br>Entry for principal sge/sdremote.hpc-mo.com with kvno 3, encryption
type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
<br>kadmin: quit</ol>

<h4>
DCE Instructions</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Create a "sge" principal and server account for each qmaster and execution
host. In the example below sdremote.hpc-mo.com is the qmaster host and
o2.hpc-mo.com is an execution host.</li>

<br># dce_login cell_admin
<br>Enter Password: xxxxx
<br># dcecp
<br>dcecp> principal create sge/sdremote.hpc-mo.com
<br>dcecp> group add none -member sge/sdremote.hpc-mo.com
<br>dcecp> organization add none -member sge/sdremote.hpc-mo.com
<br>dcecp> account create sge/sdremote.hpc-mo.com -group none -organization
none -mypwd xxxxx -password yyyyy
<br>dcecp> principal create sge/o2.hpc-mo.com
<br>dcecp> group add none -member sge/o2.hpc-mo.com
<br>dcecp> organization add none -member sge/o2.hpc-mo.com
<br>dcecp> account create sge/o2.hpc-mo.com -group none -organization none
-mypwd xxxxx -password yyyyy
<p>where xxxxx is the cell_admin password and yyyyy is a key you make up
for the "sge" account.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Put the "sge" key into the default keytab on the qmaster and execution
hosts</li>

<br>dcecp> keytab add /.../&lt;CELL>/hosts/&lt;HOST>/config/keytab/self
-member sge/sdremote.hpc-mo.com -key yyyyy -version 1 -nopriv
<br>dcecp> quit
<p>where &lt;CELL> is the local cell name and &lt;HOST> is the local host
name. For some DCE versions, you may need to use rgy_edit to update the
keytab file.
<p>If you currently do not run any Kerberos utilities on your DCE system
(e.g. rlogin, rcp, telnet) then you may need to set up a few Kerberos configuration
files so the Kerberos libraries that the security subprograms use will
work correctly.
<ol>
<li>
Make sure /etc/krb5.keytab points to your DCE keytab file. The DCE keytab
file is generally /etc/v5srvtab</li>

<li>
Make sure you have a valid /etc/krb5.conf file. Something like this should
be OK:</li>

<br>
<br>[libdefaults]
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default_realm = &lt;your_DCE_realm_name>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default_tkt_enctypes = des-cbc-crc
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default_tgs_enctypes = des-cbc-crc
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kdc_req_checksum_type = 2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ccache_type = 2
<br>
<br>[realms]
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;your_DCE_realm_name> = {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kdc = &lt;your_security_server_hostname>:88
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<br>
<br>[domain_realm]
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&lt;your_local_domain> = &lt;your_DCE_realm_name>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;your_local_domain> = &lt;your_DCE_realm_name></ol>

<p><br>Host and domain names in the [domain_realm] section should be specified in lowercase letters. For additional information, see the Kerberos krb5.conf(5) man page.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<h2>
<font color="#660000">Testing the security modules</font></h2>
Once the binaries are built and installed and you have configured Kerberos
or DCE, you can verify that the binaries work in your environment by
testing them standalone. First, you must obtain valid
Kerberos or DCE credentials. The following instructions assume that the
user is named joe.

<ul>
<br>$ get_cred sge > /tmp/cred.out
<br>$ su
<br># setenv KRB5CCNAME FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_test_sge
<br># put_cred -s sge -u joe -b joe &lt; /tmp/cred.out
<br># delete_cred</ul>

<h2>
<font color="#660000">Grid Engine Configuration</font></h2>
To use the security sub-programs with Grid Engine, you must switch on Kerberos
or DCE in $SGE_ROOT/{$SGE_CELL|default}/product_mode.
<br>The string that must be in the product_mode file is either sge-dce
or sgeee-dce for a DCE environment or sge-kerberos or sgeee-kerberos for
a Kerberos environment. If one of these entries is present, the Kerberos/DCE
security modules are active.
<h2>
<font color="#660000">Instructions for Grid Engine spool directories in
DFS</font></h2>
If you would like to maintain the Grid Engine spool directories in DFS,
then the Grid Engine deamons must run under a DCE identity. The best way
to accomplish this is to create a unique DCE account (e.g. "sge_daemon")
and put the key into the default keytab. To create the account, follow
the DCE Instructions above substituting the DCE account name that you choose
for "sge". Once the account is set up, you or the DCE administrator can
create directories in DFS for use by Grid Engine. The final step is to
modify the Grid Engine startup scripts. The lines which start the sge_qmaster,
sge_schedd, and sge_execd should be modified to use dce_login to start
the daemons. For example,
<p>Change:
<br>/gridengine/test/bin/arch/sge_qmaster
<br>to:
<br>dce_login sge_daemon -k /krb5/v5srvtab -e /gridengine/test/bin/arch/sge_qmaster
<p>To install Grid Engine into a DFS directory, the user should be running
as root and with the DCE Grid Engine daemon identity. The execution daemon
spool directories should be stored on a local non-DFS file system.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Turning off security"></a><font color="#660000">Turning off security</font></h2>
The security modules can be turned "off" globally by including the string
"NO_SECURITY" in the qmaster_params of the global cluster configuration.
The security modules can be turned "off" for all or particular execution
hosts by including the string "NO_SECURITY" in the execd_params of the
global or host-specific cluster configuration. This can be useful for an
environment where certain hosts do not support DCE or Kerberos security.
By default, the security modules authenticate that the DCE or Kerberos
principal is authorized to use the Unix account represented by the user's
user name on the qmaster host and on the execution hosts. The authentication
feature can be turned "off" globally by including the string "NO_AUTHENTICATION"
in the qmaster_params of the global cluster configuration. The authentication
feature can also be turned off for all or particular execution hosts by
including the string "NO_AUTHENTICATION" in the global or host-specific
cluster configuration. The authentication feature can also be turned on
for all or particular execution hosts by including the string "DO_AUTHENTICATION"
in the global or host-specific cluster configuration. To turn off authentication
on the qmaster host, but turn it on for some or all execution hosts, add
the string "NO_AUTHENTICATION" to the qmaster_params of the global cluster
configuration and add the string "DO_AUTHENTICATION" to the global or host-specific
cluster configuration of the execution host(s).
<h2>
<font color="#660000">Renewing credentials</font></h2>
Credentials can be automatically renewed in a Kerberos environment
through the use of the renew_cred
script included in the security distribution. In order for the script to
automatically renew credentials, users must initially obtain renewable
credentials. In Kerberos, this can be set up as the default, or users can
use the "-r" option of the kinit command. The renew_cred script should
be executed from the Grid Engine startup script.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font color="#660000">Troubleshooting</font></h2>

<ul>
<li>
When there are problems, you should always check the qmaster and execution
daemon messages files. The stderr of the security subprograms is written
to these files.</li>

<li>
If authentication fails, here are a few things to check.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Make sure the user's credentials are forwardable. If the credentials could
not be forwarded, there will be a warning message in the qmaster messages
file. You can also have the user do a klist -f and see if the TGT has the
forwardable flag set.</li>

<li>
Make sure the user's Unix name matches the user's Kerberos or DCE name.
If the names do not match, then the user cannot be authenticated. If there
is a valid reason for the mismatching names (e.g. cross-realm authentication),
then a .k5login file in the user's home directory can be used to authenticate
the user. The .k5login file, which resides in a user's home directory,
contains a list of Kerberos principals which can be used to access the
user's account. Anyone with valid tickets for a principal in the file is
allowed host access with the UID of the user in whose home directory the
file resides. Suppose the user "janedoe" had a .k5login file in her home
directory containing the following line: johndoe@FUBAR.ORG This would allow
her husband "johndoe" to use Grid Engine to access her account. However,
in order for this to work, the .k5login file must be accessible by the
qmaster deamon running on the qmaster host. If the qmaster host does not
have access to the users home directories, then the Grid Engine manager
has the option to create "dummy" home directories which simply contain
the appropriate .k5login files for the appropriate users. The dummy home
directories must be pointed to by the password file (or equivalent) on
the qmaster host. To turn off authentication, see the paragraph on <a href="#Turning off security">Turning
off security</a> above.</li>
