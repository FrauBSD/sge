<h2>
coshepherd</h2>
The cosheperd is needed to start the token manipulation executables if
Grid Engine is run in an AFS environment.
<br>The coshepherd is started by the shepherd process and belongs to the
same PAG (process authentication group) as the shepeherd and the user's
job.
<br>To assure that the token remains valid as long as the job gets executed
it is necessary to renew the job's token before it expires.
<p>Please note:
<p>The external executables that are manipulating the tokens are not part
of Grid Engine.
