<H1>Overview</H1>
<P>This paper introduces the structure of the Grid Engine scheduling
daemon. For additional source code documentation on scheduling
questions see also the description of the scheduling library
<A HREF="../../libs/sched/sched.html">libsched</A>.</P>
<H1>Communication scheme schedd-qmaster</H1>
<P>The architecture of the scheduling daemon (schedd) is elementarily
influenced by the <I>event</I> and <I>order</I> communication scheme
between qmaster and schedd. These are the major steps in this
communication scheme:</P>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Schedd initiates communication with
	qmaster by sending a special GDI (<A HREF="../../libs/gdi/gdi.html">Grid
	Engine Database Interface</A>) request to the qmaster. This
	registers schedd as an <I>event client</I> causing the qmaster to
	send the complete state of everything being relevant for scheduling
	to schedd. Later on, only state changes need to be passed to schedd.</P>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A scheduling run begins with making a
	copy of the schedd internal data. This is done because this data can
	now be modified within a scheduling run without changing the state
	resulting from the event update. Then, beginning with the most
	important job (see the following sections), the scheduler tries to
	dispatch all pending jobs to queues and generates a so called <I>order</I>
	for each of these decisions. Besides these <I>dispatch-orders</I>
	also some other orders are prepared by the scheduler e.g. to
	implement the so called suspend_thresholds (see the queue_conf(5)
	manual page).</P>

	the newest state at qmaster.</P>
</OL>
<H1>The default scheduler</H1>
<H2>Priorization of jobs</H2>
<P>The order in which runnable jobs are dispatched depends on the
policy which was selected by the administrator. Grid Engine can be
configured to support two different policy modes, one being the so
called SGE mode and the other called SG3E or SGEEE mode (the
additional EE stands for Enterprise Edition).</P>
<P>In SGE mode the administrator can enable/disable the <I>user_sort</I>
parameter in the scheduler configuration (see the sched_conf(5)
manual page). With user_sort disabled, the order in which the
scheduler examines the jobs is FCFS. With enabled user_sort the job
with the lowest amount of already running jobs is selected first and
FCFS is in effect only, if two users have the same amount of already
running jobs. In both cases the <I>-p</I> priority (see the qsub(1)
manual page) overrides FCFS and user_sort/FCFS. An efficient job
priorization scheme is implemented in the <I>access tree </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">module. The <I>access tree</I> (see sge_access_tree.c) can be seen as a
complex iterator returning the next job each time a new job is needed
in the dispatch cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
In SG3E mode all jobs receive tickets according to 4 high level
policies. The following is just a very brief overview. See the
<A HREF="/project/gridengine-download/SGE5_3alpha.pdf">product documentation</A>,
in particular the sections about scheduling in the Installation and
Administration Guide for more information.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Individual
users and projects have relative entitlements in the overall
resources of a Grid Engine cluster, so user A might be entitled to
receive 30% of all resources while user B might be entitled to 60%
and a user C to 10%. Such entitlements are relative and are meant to
be granted over time. They are relative in the sense that if user C
never uses its 10% share then those 10% are distributed among user A
and user B, but in a proportional 30:60 ratio. The granting over time
means that Grid Engine tries to achieve the entitlements over a
configurable sliding window of time, e.g. over 2 months. Such
entit</SPAN></SPAN>lements are so called long term entitlements. In
order to grant them, Grid Engine has to look at the usage of
resources which users (or projects) have accumulated in the past and
Grid Engine also has to compensate for over- or underutilization of
resources as compared to the long term entitlements. Such
compensations are done by assigning short term entitlements to the
users and projects which can differ from the long term resource
allocation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Long term entitlements are defined in a hierarchical fashion in a so
called <I>share tree</I>. The share tree can represent the
organizational structure of a site which uses GE in SG3E mode. The
leaves of the share tree always are individual projects and/or
individual users. The hierarchy level above would be groups of users
or projects, then another level above further grouping until the root
of the tree which represents the entire organization having access to
the cluster.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Again, entitlements are defined but based on functional attributes
like being a certain user or being associated with a project or a
certain user group. The entitlements are static in the sense that
Grid Engine does not look at past usage which was accumulated. So
there is no need to compensate for under- or overutilization and thus
not short term entitlements exist. Functional entitlements represent
a kind of relative priority.</P>

The automatic policies above can be overridden manually via this
policy. It allows, for instance, to double the entitlement which a
job (but also an entire project or one user) currently receives. It
is also often used to assign a constant level of entitlement to a
user, a user group or a project.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
The entitlements assigned to a particular job by each of the 4
policies above are translated into so called tickets. Each policy can
deliver an amount of tickets to a job for which all those tickets are
added together, thereby combining the 4 policies. The job with the
highest amount of tickets is investigated by the Grid Engine
scheduler first. The <I>-p</I> priority is used as a means for a user
to increase the tickets of one job and to decrease the tickets of
another one.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Note,
that the order in which the scheduler attempts to dispatch jobs (be
it in SGE or SG3E mode) often is not identical to the order in which
jobs are started. The job with the highest priority, for instance,
may not fit on any of the resources which are currently available.
Hence the second job in line may get started first. The code handling 
jobs in priority order can be found in <I>dispatch_jobs()</I> in scheduler.c.</P>

<H2>Selection of queues</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Usually there is more than one queue suitable for a certain job. In
SGE mode, the <I>queue_sort_method</I> in sched_conf(5) decides which
queue is occupied first. If queue_sort_method is defined to be <I>load</I>,
then the queue which resides at the host with the lowest load is
selected first. The queue sequence number (seq_no in queue_conf(5))
is then considered only as a second criterion in case two hosts have
the same load index. As opposed to this, if <I>seqno</I> is used as
<I>queue_sort_method</I> the queue's sequence number is the first
criterion and the load index is the second one, considered only if
two queues have the same sequence number. In both cases the
<I>load_formula</I> in sched_conf(5) specifies how the load index is
computed. In SG3E mode a procedure similar to <I>seqno </I>queue sort
method is in effect which considers also running jobs when
determining the load index. In both modes, SGE and SG3E, a user can
override this selection scheme by using so called <I>-soft </I>resource
requests (see the qsub(1) manual page). The code handling queue selection
order can be found in <I>sge_replicate_queues_suitable4job()</I> in libs/sched/sge_select_queue.c.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<H2>Dispatch strategies</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
The both chapters &quot;Priorization of Jobs&quot; and &quot;Selection
of queues&quot; describe the ruleset which is implemented, but they
describe not how this is done. The function
<B>sge_replicate_queues_suitable4job() </B>implements two different
approaches to find the best suited queue(s) with the lowest effort.
For straight sequential jobs the first matching queue is fine. For
parallel jobs, however, and for jobs with soft requests the scheduler
has to be more sophisticated before a decision can be taken which is
usually more expensive.</P>
<H1>Alternative Schedulers</H1>
<H2>Classifying Alternative Schedulers</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Alternative
schedulers can be classified in three different categories and it's
worth to become aware of the category of your scheduler, before you
start a project:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">schedulers which do not support
	the complete set of Grid Engine features</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is conceivable to have a scheduling
	algorithm which dispatches certain jobs in a more intelligent
	fashion, but (at first) it does not support interactive jobs, for
	instance. Before a scheduler of this category can be used the
	administrator must be able to assess whether the lack of certain
	features is acceptable.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">schedulers that support the
	complete Grid Engine features set 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All types of jobs, all thresholds and
	anything else is supported by this scheduler, but in a more
	intelligent fashion. A scheduler of this category could be activated
	by the administrator of a site without <I>any</I> need to change
	anything besides 'algorithm' in <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">sched_conf(5).</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">schedulers
	that extend the Grid Engine feature set</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While this might be a kind of a change
	that appears straight forward and free of complications at first
	sight, you should be aware that enhancing the Grid Engine scheduler
	with new concepts is in many cases not possible without enhancing
	the data structures with new parameters. This implies the need for
	administering these new parameters and usually makes modification in
	the user interfaces necessary. To store the settings of such new
	parameters to disc, it becomes necessary to change the file format
	in which qmaster and other components store their state. And
	changing the file format makes it necessary to think about how to
	migrate from an existing Grid Engine installation.</P>
</UL>
<H2>Scheduling API</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We know that many people are eager to
write their own schedulers and hope to find easy-to-use interfaces
for this purpose. As of today, there is no interface which at the
same time</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0in">1. offers access
to all potentially interesting information of the system,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0in">2. has the
potential for a well performing scheduler dispatching many thousand
jobs in a short time frame, and which</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But it should be possible to find
compromises and to design an interface, which is usable for a
majority of all problems. The challenge here is to keep the interface
stable.</P>
<H2>Scheduling Framework</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The
present scheduler framwork supports implementation of alternative
schedulers even though a standardized and stable scheduler interface
is not yet available. The scheduler code is organized in a way to
allow for implementing </SPAN>alternative schedulers in the same
manner as the default scheduler was implemented.<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">This
gives you the ability to reuse the existing framework.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The
first thing you will have to do will be to add your own scheduler

when starting with an alternative scheduler. Schedulers implemented
in the way suggested by the samples would be able to get activated at
schedd runtime by changing the scheduler configuration schedd_conf(5)

	The responsibility of this layer is to keep the data necessary for a

	possible approaches how to keep this data and our experience is that
	the way how this data is structured can have a crucial impact on the
	performance of a scheduling algorithm as it prepares for the
	decision-making steps. Examples substantiating this experience are
	<I>job categories</I> and the <I>access tree</I> in sge_category.c

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">We expect that some
of the functionality that was implemented for the 'default' scheduler
can be reused in many different other schedulers and it should be
possible to accumulate a collection of well-performing functions
shared between different scheduler implementations. But the 'default'
scheduler uses also many functions like <I>available_slots_at_queue()

implementation or to use them only as a pattern for an own
