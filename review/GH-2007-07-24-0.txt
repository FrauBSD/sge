5.2 Manual tests
Description: The problem can be reproduced easily. It just takes
             a queue with attribute initial_state = disabled which
             is currently enabled. Next, perform a clean shutdown
             of qmaster. Make sure that all execd's will notice that
             qmaster is down; this will cause all execd's to re-register
             once qmaster is back again. As a result, you will see
             the queue in state 'disabled'.

             This is a bug.

             The combo qmaster/execd with this fix do not exhibit
             this bug.
