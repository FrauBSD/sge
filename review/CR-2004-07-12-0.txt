1.3 Summary       : - cl_com_tcp_connection_complete_request() got
                      a new parameter to handle only "read", only "write"
                      or "read and write" connection establisment.
                      ( read and write thread did both and produced a 
                       one second timeout for multithreaded clients. Now
                       the read thread will only read and the write thread
                       will only write. A non multithreaded commlib will
                       do both, read and write )
                    - new function cl_commlib_search_endpoint(): The
                      function will return an endpoint list with connected
                      clients.
                    - moved some functions to new module: cl_xml_parsing.c
