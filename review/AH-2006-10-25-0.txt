5.3 Manual tests
Description: Use 8 execd's each with 20 slots, a qmaster with classic spooling 
over NFS, and 1 second for schedule interval. Then submit a larger array job 
such as "qsub -t 1-2600 $SGE_ROOT/examples/jobs/sleeper.sh 1"
and observe qmaster messages file and watch out for loggings in question.
Another test manually performed was the use of a large scheduling interval 
larger than the time it took qmaster to do all spooling operations upon order 
processing (180 seconds). 
To further verify the correctness of the change a manual test was performed
where sgemaster -migrate was issued on host B after former qmaster on host 
A was shutdown. The test showed that sge_schedd on host A still does finish 
as expected after host B qmaster took over.
