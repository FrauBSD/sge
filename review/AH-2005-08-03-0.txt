                            - Fixed problems with non-reentrant parsing of
                              -a datetime/-dl datetime
                            - Removed all qmaster/libdrmaa link dependencies to non-reentrant
                              C library functions for Solaris/Linux and added monitoring to
                              make procedure to ensure qmaster/libdrmaa remain free of
                              non-reentrant link dependencies
