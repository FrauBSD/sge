      "Suggested Fix" contains demands which are enhancement requests:
   
      - The submitter of the issue should file an Enhancement Request to get error
        output in one "80 character" line is not always possbile.

      - can't change start-up delay when execd can't bind port, because this might
        have several side effects. If a customer is doing a
        > qconf -ke host ; $SGE_ROOT/bin/$ARCH/sge_execd
        whouldn't work without timeout. This would result in the problem that
        the former running execd is killed and the second will not start, because
        to former running execd isn't down at starttime of the second.

        => Can't change interface for updates!!!

      - some parts are already fixed by 6267245 bugtrag issue

      - changing reconnect interval from 1 to 30 which will increase the reconnect
        time of the execd's when qmaster is restarted
