5.2 Manual tests
Description:
- disable all queues
- submit a qrsh job with -now no: qrsh -now no $SGE_ROOT/examples/jobs/sleeper.sh
- kill -9 the qrsh
- enable all queues

Without the fix, we see one queue after the other going into error state, the job 
being rescheduled over and over again.
qacct shows 
failed       11  : before job

With the fix, the job vanishes, no queue is in error state.
qacct shows
failed       19  : before writing exit_status

Ran testsuite tests (qrsh, tight_integration) to make sure nothing else
got broken.
