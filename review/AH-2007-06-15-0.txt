AH-2007-06-15-0: Bugfix:    - Integrated resource quota and queue matching code
                              for sequential jobs
                            - Use resource quota result caching also for parallel jobs
                            - Added quick exit for parallel matching code when just
                              a single slot is requested
                            - Duplicate scheduling info messages for reservation jobs
                            - Resource reservation broken for jobs depending on RQS
                              specified for subset of queues only
                            - Fixed issue with wildcard PE requests being used during
                              parallel matching for a specific PE
