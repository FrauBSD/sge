CR-2005-07-29-0: Bugfix:    - enabled multithreaded startup of scheduler daemon
                              (Part 2)
                              Fixed problems for linux 2.4 Kernel pthread library
                              implementation
                            - cleanup and TODO comments for sge_terminate() signal
                              handler function
                            - new parameter for get_conf_and_daemonize(): 
                              added an abort variable (modified by signal handler)
                            - scheduler startup: commlib threads are now started as
                              admin user
                            - fixed core dump for multithreaded commlib clients trying
                              to connect to a service which is unavailable.
                 Review:    SG
                 Changed:   sig_handlers.c execd scheduler commlib utilib gdi
