5 Tests

5.1 Used memory leak debugger
5.1 [ ] yes
5.1 [x] no - comment: This change does not allocate dynamic memory.

5.2 Manual tests
Description: This problem only happens when a project is specified which
             in turn causes a validation during qmaster startup. But this
             configuration does not yet exist since user/project configuration
             gets executed after scheduler configuration.

             A simple test setup with this scenario does reproduce the
             problem right away (i.e. qmaster fails to create the
             reprioritize cull list element).

             Implementing the fix resolves the problem right away w/o any
             further testing.
