5.3 Manual tests
Description: Send 100 concurrent qsub -sync y into a cluster with 5000 pending 
jobs. Measure time spent in each master side sge_add_event_client() call using 
dtrace enhancement (attached to CR). After the fix sge_add_event_client() no 
longer took significant time. All qsub -sync y are regularly processed without 
throttling qmaster notably.
Tested DRMAA session recovering still works (test_drmaa ST_RECOVERABLE_SESSION).
